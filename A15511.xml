            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

their prroper places, that in his whole Booke he hath not ſo much as once
truly and really fallen vpon the point in queſtion, which was, Whether both
Catholiques and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants can be ſaued in their ſeuerall
profeſſions. And therefore <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> iudiciouſly
preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <pb n="2" facs="tcp:20773:6"/>thoſe particulars, wherein the difficultie
doth preciſely conſiſt, proues in generall, that there is but one true
Church; that all Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are obliged to hearken to her; that ſhe muſt
be euer viſible, and infallible; that to ſeparate ones ſelfe from her
Communion is Schiſme, and to diſſent from her doctrine is Hereſie,
though it be in points neuer ſo few, or neuer ſo ſmall in their own
nature; and therefore that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of points fundamentall, and not
fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall is wholy vaine, as it is applied by Proteſtants. Theſe (I
ſay) and ſome other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall grounds <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> handles,
and out of them doth cleerely euince, that any leaſt difference in faith
cannot ſtand with ſaluation on both ſides: and therefore ſince it is
apparent, that Catholiques and Proteſtants diſagree in very many points of
Faith, they both cannot hope to be ſaued without repentance: and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, as we hold, that Proteſtancy vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented <hi>destroies
Saluation;</hi> ſo muſt they alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſaued, if
they iudge their own Religion to be true, and ours to be falſe. And
whoſoeuer diſguizeth this truth, is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſoules, which he
deceiues with vngroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded falſe hopes of ſaluation, indifferent Faiths, and

that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to haue been his deſigne, which was not to deſcend to
particuler diſputes, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly does, namely, Whether

and much leſſe whether Generall Councels be infallible; whether the Pope
may erre in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees common to the whole Church; whether he be aboue a
Generall Councell; whether all points of fayth be contained in Scripture;
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fayth be reſolued into the authority of the Church, as into his

and Index Expurgatorius: all which and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles <hi>D.
Potter</hi> (as I ſaid) drawes by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence into his Booke. &amp; he might as
well haue brought in Pope <hi>loane,</hi> or Antichriſt, or the Iewes who are
permitted to liue in Rome, which are common Themes for men that want better
matter, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> was forced to fetch in the aforſayd

is leſſe excuſable, becauſe he muſt graunt, that thoſe very
particulers to which he digreſſeth, are not fundamentall errors, though it
ſhould be granted that they be errors, which indeed are Catholique verities.
For ſince they be not fundamentall, nor deſtructiue of ſaluation, what
imports it whether we hold them or no, for as much as concernes our
poſſibility to be ſaued?</p>
            <p n="3">3. In one thing only he will perhaps ſeeme to haue touched
the point in queſtion, to wit, in his diſtinction of points fundamentall,
and not fundamentall: becauſe ſome may thinke, that a difference in points
which are not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall breakes not the Vnity of Faith, and hinders not the
hope of ſaluation in perſons ſo diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And yet in this very
diſtinction, he neuer ſpeakes to the purpoſe indeed, but only ſayes,
that there are ſome points ſo fundamentall, as that all are obliged to know
and <hi>belieue</hi> them explicitely, but neuer tells vs, whether there be any
other points of faith, which a man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or <hi>disbelieue,</hi> though
they be ſufficiently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his vnderſtanding, as truths reuealed,
or teſtified by almighty God; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was the only <pb n="5" facs="tcp:20773:7"/>thing in
queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if it be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable, as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is, to deny, or disbelieue
any one truth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by almighty God, thogh the thing be not in it
ſelf of any great conſequence, or moment; &amp; ſince of two
diſagreeing in matters of faith, one muſt neceſſarily deny ſome
ſuch truth; it cleerly followes that amongſt men of different Faiths, or
Religions, one onely can be ſaued, though their difference conſiſt of
diuers, or but euen one point, which is not in his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fundamentall,
as I declare at large in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places of my <hi>first Part.</hi> So that it
is cleere, <hi>D. Potter</hi> euen in this his laſt refuge and
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, neuer comes to the point in queſtion: to ſay nothing that
he himſelfe doth quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it, and plainly contradict his whole
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, as I ſhew in the third Chapter of my <hi>first Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And as for <hi>D. Potters</hi> manner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
thoſe very points, which are vtterly beſide the purpoſe, it conſiſts,
only in bringing vulgar meane obiections, which haue been anſwered a
thouſand tymes, yea, and ſome of them are cleerely anſwered euen in
<hi>Charity Mistaken;</hi> but he takes no knowledge at all of any ſuch
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, and much leſſe doth he apply himſelfe to confute them. He
alledgeth alſo Authors with ſo great corruption and fraude, as I would not
haue belieued, if I had not found it by cleere, and frequent experience. In his
ſecond <hi>Edition,</hi> he hath indeed left out one or two groſſe
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, <pb n="6" facs="tcp:20773:8"/>amongſt many others no leſſe noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
hauing as it ſeemes been warned by ſome friends, that they could not
ſtand with his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: but euen in this his ſecond <hi>Edition</hi> he
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts them not at all, nor declares that he was miſtaken in the
<hi>First,</hi> and ſo his Reader of the firſt <hi>Edition</hi> ſhall
euer be deceiued by him, thogh withall he reade the <hi>Second.</hi> For
preuenting of which inconuenience, I haue thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take
notice of them, and to diſcouer them in my <hi>Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. And for concluſion of this point I will only ſay,
that <hi>D. Potter</hi> might well haue ſpared his paines if he had
ingenuouſly acknowledged, where the whole ſubſtance, yea and ſometime
the very words &amp; phraſes of his booke may be found in farre briefer
manner, namely, in a <hi>Sermon</hi> of <hi>D. Vshers</hi> preached before our
late ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lord <hi>King Iames</hi> the 20. of Iune. 1624. at
<hi>Wansted,</hi> containing <hi>A Declaration of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality of the
Church of Christ, and the Vnity of Fayth, profeſſed therein,</hi> which
Sermon hauing been roundly and wittily confuted by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Diuine, vnder
the name of <hi>Paulus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridicus,</hi> within the compaſſe of about 4.
ſheetes of Paper, <hi>D. Potters Anſwere to Charity Mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> was in
effect confuted before it appeared. And this may ſuffice for a generall
Cenſure of his Anſwere to <hi>Charity Miſtaken.</hi>

            <p n="6">6. For the ſecond, touching my <hi>Reply:</hi> if you

without repentance can be ſaued; which ayme exacted no great bulke. And as
for <hi>D. Potters Anſwere,</hi> euen that alſo is not ſo ſhort as it
may ſeeme. For if his marginall notes prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a ſmall letter were
transfered into the Text, the Booke would appeare to be of ſome bulke: though
indeed it might haue been very ſhort, if he had kept himſelf to the point
treated by <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> as ſhall be declared anon. But
contrarily, becauſe the queſtion debated <pb n="8" facs="tcp:20773:9"/>betwixt
<hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> &amp; <hi>D. Potter,</hi> is a point of the higheſt
conſequence that can be imagined, &amp; in regard that there is not a more
pernicious Hereſy, or rather indeed ground of Atheiſme, then a
perſuaſion that men of different Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be ſaued, if otherwiſe
forſooth they lead a kind of ciuill and morall life: I concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that my
chiefe endeauour was not to be employed in anſwering <hi>D. Potter,</hi> but
that it was neceſſary to handle the Queſtion it ſelfe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what at

Catholikes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaued; but to ſhew alſo, that Saluation cannot be
hoped for out of the Catholique Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church; and yet withall, not to omit to
anſwere all the particules of <hi>D Potters</hi> Booke which may any way
import. To this end I thought it fit, to deuide my <hi>Reply</hi> into <hi>two
Parts:</hi> in the former whereof, the maine queſtion is handled by a

Anſwere,</hi> though yet ſo, as that euen in this firſt <hi>Part,</hi> I
omit not to anſwere ſuch paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his, as I find directly in my
way, and naturally belong to the points wherof I treat: &amp; in the ſecond
<hi>Part</hi> I anſwere <hi>D. Potters</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, <hi>Section</hi> by
<hi>Section,</hi> as they lie in order I heer therefore intreate the Reader,
that if hartily he deſire ſatisfaction in this ſo important que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
he do not content himſelfe with that which I ſay to <hi>Doctour Potter</hi>
in my ſecond <pb n="9" facs="tcp:20773:9"/>
               <hi>Part,</hi> but that he take the
<hi>First</hi> before him, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all, or at leaſt ſo much as may ſerue
moſt to his purpoſe of being ſatisfied in thoſe doubts which preſſe
him moſt. For which purpoſe I haue cauſed a Table of the Chapters of the
firſt <hi>Part,</hi> together with their Titles &amp; Arguments, to be
prefixed before my Reply.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This was then a chiefe reaſon why I could not be very
ſhort. But yet there wanted not alſo diuers other cauſes of the ſame
effect. For there are ſo ſeuerall kinds of Proteſtants, through the
difference of Tenets which they hold, as that if a man conuince but one kind of
them, the reſt will conceiue themſelues to be as truly vnſatisfyed and
euen vnſpoken to, as if nothing had been ſaid therein at all. As for
example, ſome hold a neceſſity of a perpetuall viſible Church, and
ſome hold no ſuch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Some of them hold it neceſſary to be
able to proue it diſtinct from ours; &amp; others, that their buſineſſe
is diſpatched when they haue proued ours to haue beene alwayes viſible: for
then they will conceiue that theirs hath been ſo: and the like may be truly
ſaid of very many other particulers. Beſides, it is <hi>D. Potters</hi>
faſhion, (wherein as he is very far from being the firſt, ſo I pray God
he proue the laſt of that humour) to touch in a word many triuiall old
obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which if they be not all anſwered, it will, and muſt ſerue
the turne, to make the more ignorant ſort of men belieue, and brag, as if
ſome maine <pb n="10" facs="tcp:20773:10"/>vnanſwerable matter had been ſubtily &amp;
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely omitted; and euery body knowes that ſome obiection may be very
plauſibly made in few words the cleere and ſolid anſwere where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will
require more leaues of paper then one. And in particuler <hi>D. Potter</hi>
doth couch his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Authors within the compaſſe of ſo few
lines, and with ſo great confuſeones and fraude, that it requires much
time, paines, and paper to open them ſo diſtinctly, as that they may
appeare to euery mans eye. It was alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſhew, what <hi>D.
Potter</hi> omits in <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> and the importance of what is
omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſometimes to ſet downe the very words themſelues that are
omitted, all which could not but add to the quantity of my <hi>Reply.</hi> And
as for the <hi>quality</hi> thereof, I deſire thee (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to belieue,
that whereas nothing is more neceſſary the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Bookes for anſwering of
Bookes: yet I was ſo ill furniſhed in this kind, that I was forced to omit
the examination of diuers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors cited by <hi>D. Potter,</hi> meerely vpon
neceſſity; though I did very well perceaue by moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
circumſtances, that I muſt probably haue been ſure inough to find them
plainely miſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, and much wronged: and for the few which are examined,
there hath not wanted ſome difficulties to do it. For the times are not for
all men alike; and <hi>D. Potter</hi> hath much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage therein. But Truth
is Truth, and will euer be able to iuſtify it ſelfe in the midſt of all 
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20773:10"/>difficulties which may occurre. As for me, when I alledge
Proteſtant Writers as well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall, as forraine, I willingly and
thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledge my ſelfe obliged for diuers of them to the Author of
the Booke entituled, <hi>The Protestants Apology for the Roman Church,</hi> who
calls himſelfe <hi>Iohn Brereley,</hi> whoſe care, exactnes, and fidelity
is ſo extraordinary great, as that he doth not only cite the Bookes, but the
Editions alſo, with the place and time of their printing, yea and often the
very page, and line where the words are to be had. And if you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen not to
find what he cites, yet ſuſpend your iudgment, till you haue read the
corrections placed at the end of his booke; though it be alſo true, that
after all diligence and faithfulnes on his behalfe, it was not in his power to
amend all the faults of the print: in which prints we haue difficulty inough
for many euident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which muſt needs occur to any prudent man.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And for aſmuch as concernes the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of my
<hi>Reply,</hi> I haue procured to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all bitternes, or gall of
inuectiue words, both for as much as may import either Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in
generall, or <hi>D. Potters</hi> perſon in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer; vnles, for example,
he will call it bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for me to terme a groſſe impertinency, a
<hi>ſleight,</hi> or a <hi>corruption,</hi> by thoſe very names, without
which I do not know how to expreſſe the things: and yet wherein I can truly
affirme <pb n="12" facs="tcp:20773:11"/>that I haue ſtudied how to deliuer them in the
moſt moderate way, to the end I might giue as little offence as poſſibly
I could, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the Cauſe. And if any vnfit phraſe may
peraduenture haue eſcaped my pen (as I hope none hath) it was beſide, and
againſt my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though I muſt needs profeſſe, that <hi>D.
Potter</hi> giues ſo many and ſo iuſt occaſions of being round with
him, as that perhaps ſome will iudge me to haue been rather remiſſe, then
moderate. But ſince in the very Title of my <hi>Reply</hi> I profeſſe to
<hi>maintaine Charity,</hi> I conceiue that the exceſſe will be more
excuſable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all kinds of men, if it fall to be in mildnes, then if
it had appeared in too much zeale. And if <hi>D. Potter</hi> haue a mind to
charge me with ignorance or any thing of that nature, I can, and will eaſe
him of that labour, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging in my ſelfe as many &amp; more
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall defects, then he can heape vpon me. Truth only and ſincerity I
ſo much valew and profeſſe, as that he ſhall neuer be able to proue the
contrary in any one leaſt paſſage or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle againſt me.</p>

                  </gap>oynders.</note> In the third &amp; laſt place, I haue thought fit
to expreſſe my ſelfe thus. If <hi>D. Potter,</hi> or any other reſolue
to anſwere my <hi>Reply;</hi> I deſire that he will obſerue ſome things
which may tend to his owne reputation, the ſauing of my vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
paines, and eſpecially to the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of truth. I wiſh then that
he would be <pb n="13" facs="tcp:20773:11"/>carefull to conſider, wherein the point of
eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficulty conſiſts, and not impertinently to ſhoote at Rouers,
and affectedly miſtake one thing for another. As for example, to what
purpoſe (for as much as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernes the queſtion betweene <hi>D. Potter</hi>
and <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi>) doth he ſo often and ſeriouſly labour to
proue, that fayth is not reſolued into the Authority of the Church, as into
the formall <hi>Obiect</hi> and <hi>Motiue</hi> thereof? Or that all points of
Fayth are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture? Or that the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make new Articles
of fayth? Or that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it ſignifies that
particuler Church or dioceſſe, is not all one with the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
Church? Or that the Pope as a priuate Doctour may erre? With many other ſuch
points as will eaſily appeare in their proper pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It wil alſo be
neceſſary for him not to put certaine Doctrines vpon vs, from which he
knowes we diſclaime as much as himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I muſt in like manner intreate him not to recite my
reaſons &amp; diſcourſes by halfes, but to ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> down faythfully
&amp; entirely, for as much as in very deed concernes the whole ſubſtance
of the thing in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; becauſe the want ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of one word may
chance to make voyd, or leſſen the force of the whole argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And I am
the more ſolicitous about giuing this particuler caueat, becauſe I find how
ill he hath complied with the promiſe which he made in his Preface to the
Reader, not to omit <hi>without anſwere any <pb n="14" facs="tcp:20773:12"/>one thing of
moment in all the diſcourſe of Charity Mistaken.</hi> Neither will this
courſe be a cauſe that his <hi>Reioynder</hi> grow too large, but it will
be occaſion of breuity to him, and free me alſo from the paines of
ſetting downe all the words which he omits, and himſelf of demonſtrating
that what he omitted was not materiall. Nay I will aſſure him, that if he
keep himſelfe to the point of euery difficulty, and not weary the Reader, and
ouercharge his margent, with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary quotations of Authors in Greeke
and Latin, and ſometime alſo in Italian and French, togeather with
prouerbs, ſentences of Poets, and ſuch grammaticall ſtuffe, nor affect to
cite a multitude of our Catholique Schoole deuines to no purpoſe at all; his
Booke will not exceed a competent ſize, nor will any man in reaſon be
offended with that length which is regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by neceſſity. Agayne before
he come to ſet downe his anſwere, or propoſe his Arguments, let him
conſider very wel what may be replied, and whether his owne obiections may
not be retorted againſt himſelfe, as the Reader will perceiue to haue
hapned often to his diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in my <hi>Reply</hi> againſt him But
eſpecially I expect, and Truth it ſelfe exacts at his hand, that he
ſpeake cleerly and diſtinctly, and not ſeeke to walke in darknes, ſo to
delude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his Reader, now ſaying, and then deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and alwayes
ſpeaking with ſuch ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as that his greateſt care may ſeeme to
conſiſt <pb n="15" facs="tcp:20773:12"/>in a certaine art to find a ſhift, as his
occaſions might chance, eyther now, or heereafter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and as he
might fall out to be vrged by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernty of ſeuerall arguments. And to the end
it may appeare, that I deale plainely, as I would haue him alſo do, I
deſire that he declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe concerning theſe points.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Firſt, whether our Sauiour Chriſt haue not alwayes

            <p n="12">12. Secondly, what viſible Church there was before
<hi>Luther,</hi> diſagreeing from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and agreeing
with the pretended Church of Proteſtants.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Thirdly, Since he will be forced to grant that there
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be aſſigned no viſible true Church of Chriſt, diſtinct from the

fundamentally; becauſe euery ſuch errour deſtroies the nature and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Church, and ſo our Sauiour Chriſt ſhould haue had no viſible
Church on earth.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Fourthly, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did not fall
into any fundamentall errour, let him tell vs how it can be <hi>damnable</hi>
to liue in her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or to maintaine errours, which are knowne &amp;

            <p n="16">16. Sixtly, if <hi>D. Potter</hi> haue a mind to ſay,
that her Errours are damnable, or fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, let him do vs ſo much
charity, as to tell vs in particuler what thoſe fundamentall errours be. But
he muſt ſtill remember (and my ſelfe muſt be excuſed, for repeating
it) that if he ſay the Roman Church e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

let him tel vs how Proteſtants had, or can haue any Church which was
vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, and extended herſelfe to all ages, if once he grant, that the

they can hope for Saluation, if they deny it to vs.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Seauenthly, whether any one Errour maintayned againſt
any one Truth though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ſmall in it ſelfe, yet ſufficiently

we ſee that they differ when they come to aſſigne what points in

to theſe points, he would let vs know diſtinctly, what is the doctrine of
the Prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtant Engliſh
Church concerning them, and what he vtters only as his owne priuate
opinion.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Theſe are the queſtions which for the preſent I
find it fit and neceſſary for me to aske of <hi>D. Potter,</hi> or any
other who will defend his cauſe, or impugne ours. And it will be in vaine to
ſpeake vainely, and to tell me, that a Foole may aske more queſtions in an
houre, then a wiſeman can anſwere in a yeare; with ſuch idle Prouerbs as
that. For I aske but ſuch queſtions <pb n="18" facs="tcp:20773:14"/>as for which he
giues occaſion in his Booke, and where he declares not himſelfe but after
ſo ambiguous and confuſed a manner, as that Truth it ſelfe can ſcarce
tell how to conuince him ſo, but that with ignorant and ill-iudging men he
will ſeeme to haue ſomewhat left to ſay for himſelfe, though Papiſts
(as he calls them) and Puritans ſhould preſſe him contrary wayes at the
ſame tyme: and theſe queſtions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne things alſo of high
importance, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the knowledge of Gods Church, &amp; true Religion,
and conſequently Saluation of the ſoule depends. And now becauſe he
ſhall not taxe me with being like thoſe men in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell whom our
bleſſed Lord and Sauiour char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with laying heauy burdens vpon other mens
ſhoulders, who yet would not touch them with their finger: I oblige my
ſelfe to anſwere vpon any demaund of his, both to all theſe Queſtions,
if he find that I haue not done it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and to any other concerning matter
of faith that he ſhall aske. And I will tell him very plainly, what is
Catholique doctrine, and what is not, that is, what is defined or what is not
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and reſts but in diſcuſſion among De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines.</p>
            <p n="22">22. And it will be heere expected, that he performe theſe
things, as a man who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth learning ſhould doe, not flying from
que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions which concerne things as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in their owne
nature, to accidentall, or <pb n="19" facs="tcp:20773:14"/>rare circumſtances of
ignorance, incapacity, want of meanes to be inſtructed, erroneous
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the like, which being very vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and different, cannot be
well comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder any generall Rule. But in deliuering generall
doctrines we muſt conſider things as they be <hi>ex naturarei,</hi> or
<hi>per ſe loquendo</hi> (as Deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſpeake) that is, according to their
natures, if all circumſtances concurre proportionable thereunto. As for
example ſome may for a time haue inuincible ignorance, euen of ſome
fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall article of fayth, through want of capacity, inſtruction, or the
like, and ſo not offend eyther in ſuch ignorance or errour; and yet we
muſt abſolutely ſay, that errour in any one fundamentall point is
damnable, becauſe ſo it is, if we conſider things in themſelues,
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from accidentall circumſtances in particuler perſons: as
contrarily if ſome man iudge ſome act of vertue, or ſome indifferent
action to be a ſinne, in him it is a ſinne indeed, by reaſon of his
erroneous conſcience; and yet we ought not to ſay abſolutely, that
vertuous, or indifferent actions are ſinnes: and in all ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences we muſt
diſtinguiſh the generall Rules from their particuler Exceptions. And
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when, for example, he anſwers to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whether he hold that
Catholiques may be ſaued, or whether their pretended errours be fundamentall
and damnable, he is not to change the ſtate of the queſtion, and haue
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <pb n="20" facs="tcp:20773:15"/>to Ignorance, and the like, but to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
concerning the errours being conſidered what they are apt to be in
themſelues, and as they are neyther increaſed nor diminiſhed, by
accidentall circumſtances.</p>
            <p n="23">23. And the like I ſay of all the other points, to which
I once againe deſire an anſwere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of theſe, or the like
ambiguous termes, <hi>in ſome ſort, in ſome ſeaſe, in ſome
degree,</hi> which may be explicated afterward as ſtrictly or lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely as may
beſt ſerue his turne; but let him tell vs roundly and particulerly, in what
ſort, in what ſenſe, in what degree he vnderſtands thoſe, &amp; the
like obſcure mincing phraſes. If he proceed ſolidly after this manner,
and not by way of meere words, more like a Preacher to a vulgar Auditour, then
like a learned man with a pen in his hand, thy patience ſhall be the
leſſe abuſed, and truth will alſo receiue more right. And ſince we
haue already layed the grounds of the queſtion, much may be ſayd heereafter
in few words, if (as I ſayd) he keep cloſe to the reall point of euery
difficulty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wandring into impertinent diſputes, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying vulgar
and threed-bare obiections and arguments, or labouring to proue what no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
denies, or making a vaine oſtentation by citing a number of Schoolemen, which
euery Puny brought vp in Schooles is able to doe; and if he cite his Authours
with ſuch ſincerity, as no time need be ſpent in opening his
corruptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:20773:15"/>and finally if he ſet himſelfe a
worke with this conſideration, that we are to giue a moſt ſtrict accompt
to a moſt iuſt, and vnpartiall Iudge, of euery period, line, and word that
paſſeth vnder our pen. For if at the later day we ſhall be arraigned for
euery idle word which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſo much more will that be done for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
idle word which is written, as the delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherwith it paſſeth makes
a man guilty of more malice, and as the importance of the matter which is
treated of in bookes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning true fayth and religion, without which no
Soule can be ſaued, makes a mans Errours more materiall, then they would be,

               <p n="3">3. Moreouer, our meaning is not, as miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
perſons may conceiue, that we giue Proteſtants ouer to reprobation; that we
offer no prayers in hope of their ſaluation; that we hold their caſe
deſperate. God forbid! We hope, we pray for their Conuerſion; and
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we find happy effects of our charitable deſires. Neither is our
Cenſure immediatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to particuler perſons. The Tribunall of
particuler Iudgment is Gods alone. When any man eſteemed a Proteſtant,
leaueth to liue in this world, we do not inſtantly with precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
auouch, that he is lodged in Hell. For we are not alwayes acquainted with what
ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency or meanes he was furniſhed for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; we do not
penetrate his capacity to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his Catechiſt; we haue no reuelation
what light might haue cleered his errours, or Contrition retracted his
ſinnes, in the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before his death. In ſuch particuler caſes,
we wiſh more apparent ſignes of ſaluation but do not giue any dogmaticall
ſentence of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion How grieuous ſinnes, <hi>Diſobedience,
Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> and <hi>Hereſy</hi> are, is well knowne. But to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
how far the naturall malignity of thoſe great offences might be checked by

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20773:19"/>office, rather of <hi>Prudence,</hi> then of
<hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Thus we allow Proteſtants as much Charity, as <hi>D.

                  </note> makes

we expect from the fierce do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of thoſe chiefe Proteſtants, who teach
that for many ages before <hi>Luther,</hi> Chriſt had no viſible Church

themſelues. In a certaine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Chriſtian faith, at the

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. But yet leſt any man ſhould flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with our charitable Mitigations, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by waxe careles in ſearch of the
true Church, we deſire him to reade the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the
<hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part,</hi> where this matter is more explayned.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And, becauſe we cannot determine, <pb n="30" facs="tcp:20773:20"/>what <hi>Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</hi> may be eſteemed <hi>rash,</hi> or
<hi>prudent,</hi> except by weighing the reaſons vpon which it is grounded,
we will heere, vnder one aſpect, preſent a Summary of thoſe Principles,
from which we infer, that Proteſtancy in it ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented deſtroyes
Saluation: intending after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to proue the truth of euery one of the grounds,
till, by a concatenation of ſequels, we fall vpon the <hi>Concluſion,</hi>
for which we are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with <hi>Want of Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Now, this is our gradation of reaſons. Almighty God,
hauing ordained Mankind to a ſupernaturall <hi>End</hi> of eternall felicity;
hath in his holy Prouidence ſetled competent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient <hi>Meanes,</hi>
whereby that end may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The vniuerſall grand Origen of all ſuch
meanes, is the Incarnation and Death of our Bleſſed Sauiour, whereby he
merited internall grace for vs; and founded an <hi>externall</hi> viſible
Church, prouided and ſtored with all thoſe helps which might be
neceſſary for Saluation. From hence it followeth, that in this Church
amongſt other aduantages, there muſt be ſome effectuall meanes to beget,
and conſerue fayth, to maintaine Vnity, to diſcouer and condemne
Hereſies, to appeaſe and reduce Schiſmes, and to determine all
Controuerſies in Religion. For without ſuch meanes, the Church ſhould not
be furniſhed with helps ſufficient to ſaluation, not God affoard
ſufficient meanes to attayne that End, to which himſelfe ordained Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20773:20"/>This meanes to decide Controuerſies in fayth and Religion
(whether it ſhould be the holy Scripture, or whatſoeuer elſe) muſt be
indued with an Vniuerſall Infallibility, in whatſoeuer it propoundeth for a
diuine truth, that is, as reuealed, ſpoken, or teſtifyed by Almighty God,
whether the matter of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be great or ſmall. For if it were
ſubiect to errour in any one thing, we could not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other yield it
infallible aſſent; becauſe we might with good reaſon doubt, whether it
chanced not to erre in that particuler.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Thus farre all muſt agree to what we haue ſaid,
vnleſſe they haue a mind to reduce <hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>Opinion.</hi> And
euen out of theſe grounds alone, without further proceeding, it vndeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
followes, that of two men diſſenting in matters of faith, great or ſmall,
few or many, the one cannot be ſaued without repentance, vnles Ignorance
accidentally may in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler perſon, plead excuſe. For in that
caſe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary beliefe, one muſt of neceſſity be held to oppoſe
Gods word, or Reuelation ſufficiently repreſented to his vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding by
an infallible Propounder; which oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Teſtimony of God is
vndoutedly a damnable ſin, whether otherwiſe, the thing ſo teſtifyed,
be in it ſelfe great or ſmall. And thus we haue already made good, what was
promiſed in the argument of this Chapter, that <hi>amongſt men of different
Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,</hi> one is only capable of being ſaued.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:20773:21"/>
               <p n="9">9. Neuertheles, to the end that men may know in particular
what is the ſayd infallible meanes vpon which we are to rely in all things
concerning Fayth, and accordingly may be able to iudge in what ſafety or
danger, more or leſſe they liue; and becauſe <hi>D. Potter</hi>
deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to diuers particulers about Scriptures and the Church &amp;c. we

in whoſe Iudgment they may reſt, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting and propounding of
Gods Word or Reuclation. And this liuing Iudge, we will moſt euidently proue
to be no other, but that Holy, Catholique, Apoſtolique, and Viſible Church,
which our Sauiour purchaſed with the effuſion of his moſt precious
bloud.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If once therefore it be granted, that the Church is
that means, which God hath left for deciding all Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies in faith, it
manifeſtly will follow, that ſhe muſt be infallible in all her
determinations, whether the matters of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues be great or ſmall;
becauſe as we ſayd aboue, it muſt be agreed on all ſides, that if that
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which God hath left to determine Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies <pb n="33" facs="tcp:20773:21"/>were not infallible in all things propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by it as truths reuealed
by Almighty God, it could not ſettle in our minds a firme, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
beliefe of any one.</p>
               <p n="11">11. From this Vniuerſall Infallibility of God's Church
it followeth, that whoſoeuer wittingly denieth any one point propoſed by
her, as reuealed by God, is iniurious to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty, as if he could
either deceiue, or be deceiued in what he teſtifieth. The auerring whereof
were not only a <hi>fundamentall</hi> error, but would ouerthrow the very
foundation of all fundamentall points, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance could
not poſſibly ſtand with ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Out of theſe grounds, we will ſhew, that although
the diſtinction of points <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,</hi> and not
<hi>fundamentall,</hi> be good and vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as it is deliuered and applied
by Catholique Deuines, to teach what principall Articles of faith, Chriſtians
are obliged <hi>explicitely</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue: yet that it is impertinent to the
preſent purpoſe of excuſing any man from grieuous ſinne, who knowingly
<hi>disbelieues,</hi> that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieues the contrary of that which Gods Church
propoſeth as diuine Truth. For it is one thing not to know explicitly ſome
thing teſtifyed by God, &amp; another poſitiuely to oppoſe what we know
he hath teſtified. The former may often be excuſed from ſinne, but neuer
the latter, which only is the caſe in Queſtion.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:20773:22"/>
               <p n="13">13. In the ſame manner ſhall be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that
to alleadge the <hi>Creed,</hi> as contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all Articles of faith
neceſſary to be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely belieued, is not pertinent to free from
ſinne the voluntary deniall of any other point knowen to be defined by Gods
Church. And this were ſufficient to ouerthrow all that <hi>D. Potter</hi>
alleadgeth, concerning the <hi>Creed:</hi> though yet by way of Supererogation,
we will proue, that there are diuers importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t matters of Faith which are not
mentioned at all in the Creed.</p>
               <p n="14">14. From the aforeſaid maine principle, that God hath
alwayes had, and alwaies will haue on earth, a Church <hi>Viſible,</hi>
within whoſe Communion Saluation muſt be hoped, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi>
whoſe definitions we ought to belieue; we will proue, that <hi>Luther,
Caluin,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who continue the diuiſion in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or
Faith, from that Viſible Church, which at, and before <hi>Luthers</hi>
appearance, was ſpread ouer the world, cannot be excuſed from
<hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi> and <hi>Hereſy,</hi> although they oppoſed her faith

point; wheras it is manifeſt, they diſſent from her, in <hi>many</hi> and

<hi>practiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. To theſe reaſons drawne from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of
<hi>Faith,</hi> we will add one other taken from <hi>Charitas propria,</hi> the
Vertue of <hi>Charity,</hi> as it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs, not to expoſe our ſoule to
hazard of perdition, when we can put our ſelues in a way much more ſecure,
as we will proue, that of the <pb n="35" facs="tcp:20773:22"/>Roman Catholiques to be.</p>
               <p n="16">16. We are then to proue theſe points. Firſt, that
the infallible meanes to determine controuerſies in matters of faith, is the
viſible Church of Chriſt. Secondly, that the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of points
<hi>fundamentall,</hi> and <hi>not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> maketh nothing to our
preſent Queſtion. Thirdly, that to ſay the <hi>Creed</hi> containes all
fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points of faith, is neither <hi>pertinent,</hi> nor
<hi>true.</hi> Fourthly, that both <hi>Luther,</hi> &amp; all they who after
him, perſiſt in diuiſion, from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> and
<hi>Faith</hi> of the Roman Church, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excuſed from
<hi>Schiſme</hi> Fifthly, nor from Hereſy Sixtly and laſtly, that in

be in ſtate of ſinne, as long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine diuided from the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church. And theſe ſix points, ſhall be ſeuerall
Arguments for ſo many enſuing Chapters.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Only I will heere obſerue, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth very
ſtrange, that Proteſtants ſhould char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge vs ſo deeply with <hi>Want of
Charity,</hi> for only teaching that both they, and we cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
ſeeing themſelues muſt affirme the like of whoſoeuer oppoſeth any
leaſt point deliuered in Scripture, which they hold to be the ſole Rule of
Faith Out of which ground they muſt be enforced to let all our former
Inferences paſſe for good. For, is it not a grieuous ſinne, to deny any
one truth contained in holy Writ? Is there in ſuch deniall, any diſtinction
betwixt points <pb n="36" facs="tcp:20773:23"/>fundamentall, and not fundamentall,
ſufficient to excuſe from hereſy? Is it not impertinent, to alleadge the
Creed contayning all fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points of faith, as if belieuing it alone,
we were at liberty to deny all other points of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? In a word: According
to Proteſtants; Oppoſe not Scripture, there is no Errour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt faith.
Oppoſe it in any leaſt point, the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror (if Scripture be ſufficiently
propoſed, which propoſition is alſo required before a man can be obliged
to belieue euen fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall points) muſt be damnable. What is this, but to
ſay with vs, <hi>Of perſons contrary in whatſoeuer point of beliefe, one
party only can be ſaued?</hi> And <hi>D. Potter</hi> muſt not take it ill,
if Catholiques belieue they may be ſaued in that Religion for which they
ſuffer. And if by occaſion of this doctrine, men will ſtill be charging
vs with <hi>Want of Charity,</hi> and be reſolued to <hi>take</hi> ſcandall
where none is <hi>giuen;</hi> we muſt comfort our ſelues with that graue,
and true ſaying of <hi>S. Gregory: If ſcandall</hi>
                  <note n="(l)" place="margin">S. Greg. Hom. <hi>7.</hi> in Ezes.</note> 
                  <hi>be taken from
declaring a truth, it is better to permit ſcandall, then forſake the
truth.</hi> But the ſolid grounds of our Aſſertion, and the ſincerity
of intention in vttering what we thinke, yield vs confidence, that all will
hold for moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſaying of Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> to
<hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Emperour: <hi>Farre be it from the Roman Emperour
that he should hold it for a wrong to haue truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to him.</hi> Let vs

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20773:23"/>betwixt Proteſtats &amp; vs, for as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes

vnderſtanding, that by this aſſertion Contentions are increaſed, and
not ended. We acknowledge holy Scripture, to be a moſt perfect Rule, for as
much as a writing can be a Rule: We only deny that it excludes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diuine
Tradition though it be vnwritten, or an externall Iudge to keep, to propoſe,
to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret <pb n="38" facs="tcp:20773:24"/>it in a true, Orthodoxe, and Catholique
ſenſe. Euery ſingle Booke, euery Chapter, yea euery period of holy
Scripture is infallibly true, &amp; wants no due perfection. But muſt we
ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore infer, that all other Bookes of Scripture, are to be excluded,
leaſt by addition of them, we may ſeeme to derogate from the perfection of
the former? When the firſt Bookes of the old &amp; New Teſtament were
written, they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude vnwritten Traditions, nor the Authority of the
Church to decide Controuerſies; &amp; who hath then ſo altered their
nature, &amp; filled them with ſuch iealouſies, as that now they cannot

                  </gap>iſparageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? What greater wrong is it for the written Word, to
be compartner now with the vnwritten, then for the vnwritten, which was once
alone, to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ioyned with the written? Who euer heard, that to
commend the fidelity of a Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, were to diſauthorize the thing committed
to his cuſtody? Or that, to extoll the integrity and knowledge, and to auouch
the neceſſity of a Iudge in ſuits of law, were to deny perfection in the
law? Are there not in Common wealths beſides the lawes written &amp;
vnwritten cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, Iudges appointed to declare both the one, the other, as
ſeuerall occaſions may require?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Scripture alone cannot be Iudge in
Controuerſies of faith, we gather ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cleerly. From the quality of a
writing in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: From the nature of holy Writ in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer, 
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20773:24"/>which muſt be belieued as true, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible: From the
Editions, &amp; Tranſlations of it: From the difficulty to vnderſtand it
without hazard of Errour: From the inconueniences that muſt follow vpon the
aſcribing of ſole Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature to it: &amp; finally from the Confeſſions
of our Aduerſaries. And on the other ſide, all theſe difficulties
ceaſing, and all other qualities requiſite to a Iudge concurring in the
viſible Church of Chriſt our Lord, we muſt conclude, that

                  </gap>he it is, to whom in doubts

               <p n="3">3. The name, notion, nature, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Iudge
cannot in common reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to any meere writing, which, be it
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in its kind, neuer ſo highly qualified with ſanctity and

to heare, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, to declare his mind to the diſagreeing parties in
ſuch ſort as that ech one may know whether the ſentence be in fauour of
his cauſe, or againſt his pretence; and he muſt be applia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and able to
do all this, as the diuerſity of Controuerſies perſons, occaſions, and
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may require. There is a great &amp; plaine diſtinction
betwixt a <hi>Iudge</hi> and a <hi>Rule.</hi> For as in a kingdome, the Iudge
hath his Rule to follow which are the receiued Lawes and cuſtomes; 
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20773:25"/>ſo are not they fit or able to declare, or be Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to
themſelues, but that office muſt belong to a liuing Iudge. The holy
Scripture may be, and is a Rule, but cannot be a Iudge, becauſe it being
alwayes the ſame, cannot declare it ſelfe any one time, or vpon any one
occaſion more particularly then vpon any other; and let it be read ouer an
hundred times, it wilbe ſtill the ſame, and no more fit alone to terminate
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies in faith, then the Law would be to end ſuites, if it were
giuen ouer to the phanſy, &amp; gloſſe of euery ſingle man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This difference betwixt a Iudge and a Rule, <hi>D.
Potter</hi> perceiued, when more then once, hauing ſtiled the Scripture a
<hi>Iudge,</hi> by way of correcting that terme, he adds <hi>or rather a
Rule,</hi> becauſe he knew that an inanimate writing could not be a
<hi>Iudge.</hi> Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence alſo it was, that though Proteſtants in their
beginning, affirmed Scripture alone to be the Iudge of Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; yet
vpon a more aduiſed reflection, they changed the phraſe, and ſayd, that
not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is Iudge in
Controuerſies. A difference without a diſparity. The Holy Ghoſt
ſpeaking only in Scripture is no more intelligible to vs, then the Scripture
in which he ſpeakes; as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeaking only Latin, can be no better
vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, then the tongue wherein he ſpeaketh. And therefore to ſay, a
Iudge is neceſſary for deciding controuerſies, about the meaning of 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20773:25"/>Scripture, is as much as to ſay, he is neceſſary to
decide what the Holy Ghoſt ſpeakes in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And it were a conceyt,
equally fooliſh and pernicious, if one ſhould ſeeke to take away all
Iudges in the kingdome, vpon this nicity, that albeit Lawes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be Iudges,
yet the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker ſpeaking in the Law, may performe that Office; as if the
Law-maker ſpeaking in the Law, were with more perſpicuity vnderſtood,
then the Law wherby he ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But though ſome writing were granted to haue a
priuiledge, to declare it ſelfe vpon ſuppoſition that it were maintayned
in being, and preſerued entire from corruptions; yet it is manifeſt, that
no writing can conſerue it ſelfe, nor can complayne, or denounce the
falſifier of it; and therefore it ſtands in need of ſome watchfull and
not erring eye, to guard it, by meanes of whoſe aſſured vigilancy, we may
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly receiue it ſincere and pure.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And ſuppoſe it could defend it ſelfe from
corruption, how could it aſſure vs that it ſelfe were Canonicall, and of
infallible Verity? By ſaying ſo? Of this very <hi>affirmation,</hi> there
will remaine the ſame Queſtion ſtill; how it can proue it ſelfe to be
infallibly true? Neyther can there euer be an end of the like multiplyed
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, till we reſt in the externall Authority of ſome perſon or

ſome of their chiefeſt Brethren. <hi>As they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly receiued</hi>
&amp;c. I aske: By whom? By the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Then, by the ſame

reiect. By <hi>Lutherans?</hi> Then with <hi>Lutherans</hi> they may deny
ſome Bookes of the New Teſtament. If it be the greater, or leſſe number

and then this rule of <hi>(Commonly receaued)</hi> will canonize their Canon

of their Article, they ſay both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament: In
the name of the Holy Scripture, we do vnderstand thoſe Canonicall Bookes of
the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of whoſe authority was neuer any doubt in the
Church;</hi> and in the latter part, ſpeaking againe of the <hi>New
Testament,</hi> they giue a far different <pb n="48" facs="tcp:20773:29"/>rule, ſaying:
<hi>All the Bookes of the New Testament, as they are commonly receiued, we do
receiue, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them Canonicall.</hi> This I ſay is a rule much
different from the former <hi>(Of whoſe authority was NEVER any doubt in the
Church.)</hi> For ſome Bookes might be ſaid to be <hi>Commonly

connexion with diuine <hi>Reuelation</hi> or <hi>Inſpiration:</hi> and
therefore by ſeeing, reading, or vnderſtanding them, we cannot inferre that
they proceed from God, or be confirmed by diuine authority, as becauſe

Holy Writ there are innumerable <pb n="49" facs="tcp:20773:29"/>truths not ſurpaſſing
the ſpheare of humane wit, which are, or may be deliuered by Pagan Writers,
in the ſelfe ſame words and phraſe as they are in Scripture. And as for
ſome truths peculiar to Chriſtians, (for Example, the myſtery of the
Bleſſed Trinity &amp;c.) the only ſetting them downe in <hi>Writing</hi>
is not inough to be aſſured that ſuch a <hi>Writing</hi> is the vndoubted
word of God: otherwiſe ſome ſayings of <hi>Plato, Triſmegiſtus,
Sybills, Ouid &amp;c.</hi> muſt be eſteemed Canonicall Scripture, becauſe
they fall vpon ſome truths proper to Chriſtian Religion. The internall

and therefore no wonder if Scripture doe not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it ſelfe by it

vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Neuer theles their owne ſimilitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and inſtances, make
againſt themſelues. For ſuppoſe a man had neuer read, or heard of
Sunne, Moone, Fire, Candle &amp;c. and ſhould be brought to behold a light,
yet in ſuch ſort as that the Agent, or Cauſe Efficient from which it
proceeded, were kept hidden from him; could ſuch an one, by only beholding
the light, certainly know, whether it were produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Sunne, or Moone
&amp;c? Or if one heare a voyce, and had neuer known the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, could he
know from whome in particuler <pb n="51" facs="tcp:20773:30"/>that voyce proceeded? They
who looke vpon Scripture, may well ſee, that ſome one wrote it, but that it
was written by diuine inſpiration, how shall they know? Nay, they cannot ſo
much as know who wrote it, vnles they firſt know the writer, and what hand he
writes: as likewiſe I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not know whoſe voice it is which I heare, vnles I
firſt both know the perſon who ſpeakes, &amp; with what voice he vſeth
to ſpeake; and yet euen all this ſuppoſed, I may perhaps be deceyued. For
there may be voyces ſo like, and Hand ſo counterfaited, that men may be
deceyued by them, as birds were by the grapes of that skillfull Painter. Now
ſince Proteſtants affirme knowledge concerning God as our
<hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall</hi> end, muſt be taken from Scripture, they cannot in
Scripture alone diſcerne that it is his voyce, or writing, becauſe they
cannot know from whome a writing, or voyce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, vnle, firſt they know
the perſon who ſpeaketh, or writeth Nay I ſay more: By Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture alone,
they cannot ſo much as know, that any perſon doth in it, or by it, ſpeake
any thing at all: becauſe one may write without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſignify, or
affirme any thing, but only to ſet downe, or as it were paint, ſuch
chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, ſyllables, and words, as men are wont to ſet copies, not
caring what the ſignification of the words imports; or as one tranſcribes a
writinge which himſelfe vnderſtands not: or when one writes what another
dictates, and <pb n="52" facs="tcp:20773:31"/>in other ſuch caſes, wherein it is
cleere, that the writer ſpeakes, or ſignifies nothing in ſuch his
writing; &amp; therefore by <hi>it</hi> we cannot heare, or vnderſtand
<hi>his</hi> voyce. With what certainty then can any man affirme, that by
Scripture it ſelf they can ſee, that the writers did inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify
any thing at all; that they were Apoſtles, or other Canonical Authours; that
they wrote their owne ſenſe, and not what was dictated by ſome other man;
and finally, &amp; eſpecially, that they wrote by the infallible direction of
the Holy Ghoſt?</p>
               <p n="12">12. But let vs be liberall, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſuppoſe (not grant) that Scripture is like to corporall light, by it

the eye of fayth; or, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue cited ſayth, to all that

principles, which being the firſt, and the moſt knowne in all Sciences
cannot be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by other Principles, they ſuppoſe that which is
in queſtion whether there be not ſome principle (for example, the Church)
wherby we may come to the knowledge of Scripture If they intend, that Scripture
is a Principle, but not the firſt, and moſt knowne in Chriſtianity, then
Scripture may be proued. For principles, that are not the firſt, nor knowne
of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues may, &amp; ought to be proued, before we can yield aſſent,
either to them, or to other verities depending on them. It is repugnant to
their owne doctrine, and practiſe, in as much as they are wont to affirme,
that one part of Scripture may be knowne to be Canonicall, and may be
interpreted by another. And ſince euery ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is a principle

Principle may, and ſometime muſt be proued <pb n="55" facs="tcp:20773:32"/>by another.

purpoſe. To omit (ſaith he) particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, whoſe recitall would be
infinite, &amp; to touch this point but generally only, the Tranſlation of
the New Teſtament by <hi>Luther</hi> is condemned by <hi>Andreas, Oſiander,
Keckermannus,</hi> and <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius,</hi> who ſayth hereof to <hi>Luther.
Thou dost cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the word of God, thou art ſeene to be a manifest and
common corrupter of the holy Scriptures: how much are we ashamed of thee who
haue hitherto eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thee beyond all meaſure, and now proue thee to be
ſuch a man?</hi> And in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner doth <hi>Luther</hi> reiect the
Tranſlation of the <hi>Zuinglians</hi> terming them in matter of diuinity,
fooles, Aſſes, Antichriſts, deceauers, and of Aſſe-like
vnderſtanding. In ſo much that when <hi>Proſcheuerus</hi> the Zwinglian
Printer of <hi>Zurich</hi> ſent him a Bible tranſlated by the diuines
there, <hi>Luther</hi> would not receyue the ſame, but ſending it backe
reiected it, as the Proteſtant Writers <hi>Hoſpinians,</hi> and
<hi>Lauatherus</hi> witneſſe. The tranſlation ſet forth by
<hi>Oecolam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius,</hi> and the Deuines of <hi>Baſil,</hi> is reproued by
<hi>Beza,</hi> who affirmeth that the <hi>Baſil Tranſlation is in many
places wicked, and altogeather differing from the mynd of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
The tranſlation of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalio</hi> is condemned by <hi>Beza,</hi> as being
<hi>ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <pb n="58" facs="tcp:20773:34"/>wicked, and Ethnicall.</hi> As
concerning <hi>Caluins</hi> tranſlation, that learned Proteſtant Writer

the Text of the Goſpell to leape vp and downe: he vſeth violence to the
letter of the Goſpell; and beſides this addeth to the Text.</hi> As

<hi>Seluccerus</hi> the German Proteſtant of the Vniuerſity of
<hi>Iena</hi>) the foreſaid <hi>Molinaeus</hi> ſaith of him, <hi>de facto

tranſlation, <hi>would require a great volume.</hi> And <hi>M. Parkes</hi>
ſaith: <hi>As for the Geneua Bibles, it is to be wished that either they may
be purged from thoſe manifold errors, which are both in the text, and in the

tranſlation to be worſt of all;</hi> and that in the <hi>Marginall notes
annoxed to the Geneua tranſlation, ſome are very partiall, vntrue,
ſeditious, &amp;c.</hi> Laſtly concerning the Engliſh Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the Puritanes ſay: <hi>Our tranſlation of the Pſalmes comprized in our
Booke of Common Prayer, doth in addition, ſubtraction, and alteration, differ
from the Truth of the Hebrew in two hundred pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at the least.</hi> In ſo
much as they do therefore profeſſe to reſt doubtfull, <hi>whether a man
with a <pb n="59" facs="tcp:20773:34"/>ſafe conſcience may ſubſcribe thereto.</hi>
And <hi>M. Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile</hi> ſaith of the Engliſh Tranſlators, that they
haue <hi>depraued the ſenſe, obſcured the truth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the
ignorant; that in many places they do detort the Scriptures from the right
ſenſe.</hi> And that, <hi>they ſhew themſelues to loue darknes more
then light, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood more then truth.</hi> And the Miniſters of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne
Dioceſſe giue their publike teſtimony, terming the Engliſh
Tranſlation: <hi>A Tranſlation that taketh away from the Text; that addeth
to the Text; and that, ſometime to the changing, or obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the
meaning of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe therefore did your
Maieſty affirme, that you <hi>could neuer yet ſee a Bible well tranſlated
into Engliſh.</hi> Thus far the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
Apology &amp;c.</hi> And I cannot forbeare to mention in particuler that famous
corruption of <hi>Luther,</hi> who in the Text where it is ſaid
(<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 28.) <hi>We accompt a man to be instified by
faith, without the works of the Law,</hi> in fauour of Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by
faith <hi>alone,</hi> tranſlateth <hi>(Iustified by faith A LONE.)</hi> As
likewiſe the falſification of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> is no leſſe notorious,
who in the Goſpels of <hi>S. Mathew, Mark,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> and in
<hi>S. Paul,</hi> in place of, <hi>This is my Body; This is my bloud;</hi>
tranſlates, <hi>This ſignifies my Body; This ſignifies my bloud.</hi> And
heere let Proteſtants conſider duely of theſe points. Saluation cannot be
hoped for without true faith: Faith according to them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies vpon Scripture
alone: Scripture muſt be deliuered to moſt of them by the Tranſlations: 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20773:35"/>Tranſlations depend on the skill and honeſty of men, in
whom nothing is more certaine then a moſt certaine poſſibility to erre,
and no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter euidence of Truth, then that it is euident ſome of them
imbrace falſhood, by reaſon of their contrary tranſlations. What then
remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but that truth, faith, ſaluation, &amp; all, muſt in them rely
vpon a fallible, and vncertaine ground? How many poore ſoules are lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſeduced, while from preaching Miniſters, they admire a multitude of Texts
of diuine Scripture, but are indeed the falſe tranſlations, and corruptions
of erring men? Let them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if they will be aſſured of true
Scriptures, fly to the alwayes viſible Catholique Church, againſt which the
gates of hell can neuer ſo far preuaile, as that ſhe ſhall be permitted
to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Chriſtian world with falſe Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. And <hi>Luther</hi>
himſelfe, by vnfortunate expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, was at length forced to confeſſe
thus much, ſaying: <hi>If the</hi>

tranſlation authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the Church of England, is that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
nearest to the vulgar, and is commonly called the Biſhops Bible.</hi> So that
the truth of that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation which we vſe, muſt be the rule to iudge of
the goodneſſe of their Bibles: and therefore they are obliged to maintaine
our Tranſlation if it were but for their owne ſake.</p>
               <p n="17">17. But doth indeed the ſource of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold

the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Scripture: for attayning whereof, if Proteſtants had any

or point of faith is deliuered by diuine reuelation of Gods word; if a man
himſelfe (without any Teacher) by reading the Scriptures, or hearing them
read, be conuinced of the truth of any ſuch cocluſion: this is a
ſufficient propoſition to proue him that gain ſaith any ſuch proofe, to
be an Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, and obstinate oppoſer of the faith.</hi> Behold what goodly
ſafe Propounders of fayth ariſe in place of Gods vniuerſall viſible
Church, which muſt yield to a ſingle Preacher, a Neighbour, a man
himſelfe if he can read, or at leaſt haue eares to heare Scripture read.
Verily I do not ſee, but <pb n="67" facs="tcp:20773:38"/>that euery well — gouerned
Ciuill Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, ought to concur towards the extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating of this

               <p n="23">23. Moreouer, there was no Scripture, or written word for
about two thouſand yeares from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> whom all
acknowledge to haue been the firſt Author of Canonicall Scripture: And againe
for about two thouſand yeares more, from <hi>Moyſes</hi> to Chriſt our
Lord, holy Scripture was only among the people of Iſrael; and yet there were
Gentils endewed in thoſe dayes with diuine Faith, as appeareth in
<hi>Iob,</hi> and his friends. Wherefore during ſo many ages, the Church
alone was the decider of Controuerſies, and Inſtructor of the faithfull.
Neither did the Word written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue that Church of her
former Infallibility, or other qualities requiſite for a Iudge: yea <hi>D.
Potter</hi> acknowledgeth, that beſides the <hi>Law,</hi> there was a liuing
<hi>Iudge</hi> in the Iewiſh Church, endewed with an <hi>abſolutly
infallible direction in caſes of moment;</hi> as all points belonging to
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Faith are. Now, the Church of Chriſt our Lord, was before the
Scriptures of the New Teſtament, which were not written inſtantly, nor all
at one time, but ſucceſſiuely vpon ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall occaſions; and ſome
after the deceaſe of <pb n="68" facs="tcp:20773:39"/>moſt of the Apoſtles: &amp;
after they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, they were not preſently knowne to all Churches: and
of ſome there was doubt in the Church for ſome Ages after our Sauiour.
Shall we then ſay, that according as the Church by little and little receiued
holy Scripture, ſhe was by the like degrees deueſted of her
poſſeſſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, and power to decide Controuerſies in
Religion? That ſome Churches had one Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of Controuerſies, and others
another? That with moneths, or yeares, as new Canonicall Scripture grew to be
publiſhed, the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her whole Rule of faith, or Iudge of
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies? After the Apoſtles time, and after the writing of
Scriptures, Hereſies would be ſure to riſe, requiring in Gods Church for
their diſcouery and condemnation, <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to write
new Canonicall Scripture as was done in the Apoſtles time by occaſion of
emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hereſies; or <hi>infallibility</hi> to interpret Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
already written, or, without Scripture, by diuine vn written Traditions, and
affiſtance of the holy Ghoſt to determine all Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, as

from the former power and infallibility of the Church, would haue brought to
the world <hi>diuiſion</hi> in matters of faith, and the Church had rather
loſt, then gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by holy Scripture (which ought to be far 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20773:39"/>from our tongues and thoughts,) it being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that
for deciſion of Controuerſies, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility ſetled in a liuing Iudge,
is incomparably more vſefull and fit, then if it were conceiued, as inherent
in ſome inanimate writing. Is there ſuch repugnance betwixt Infallibility
in the Church, and Exiſtence of Scripture, that the <hi>production</hi> of
the one, muſt be the <hi>destruction</hi> of the other? Muſt the Church wax
dry, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to her Children the milke of ſacred Writ? No, No. Her
Infallibility was, and is deriued from an inexhauſted fountaine. If
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> will haue the <hi>Scripture</hi> alone for their Iudge,
let them firſt produce ſome <hi>Scripture</hi> affirming, that by the
<hi>entring</hi> thereof, Infallibility <hi>went out</hi> of the Church. <hi>D.
Potter</hi> may remember what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe teacheth; That the Church is ſtil
endewed with infallibility in points fundamentall, and conſequently, that

and will he ſo vnworthily and vniuſtly depriue the Church of Chriſt of

               <p n="25">25 Beſides all this, the doctrine of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants is

finally <hi>D Potter</hi> grants, that the Church of Rome doth not maintaine

that their Tenet, about the <hi>Scriptures</hi> being <hi>the only Iudge of

teacheth that the vniuerſall Church may erre in points not fundamentall; ſo
I hope he will not deny, but particuler Churches, and priuate men, are much
more obnoxious to error in ſuch points; and in particuler in this, that
<hi>Scripture alone is Iudge of Controuerſies:</hi> And ſo, the very
principle vpon which their whole faith is grounded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines to them
vncertaine; and on the other ſide, for the ſelfe ſame reaſon, they are
not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but that the Church is Iudge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, which if ſhe
be, then their caſe is lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, who in <hi>generall</hi> deny her this

moſt inſiſt vpon the diſtinction of points fundamentall, and not
fundamentall, and in particular teach, that the Church may erre in points not
fundamentall, it will be neceſſary to examine the truth, and weight of this
euaſion, which ſhall be done in the next Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> That the diſtinction of points
funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and not fundamentall, is neither pertinent, nor true in our

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS diſtinction is abuſed by Proteſtants to many
purpoſes of theirs, and therfore if it be either vntrue or impertinent (as
they vnderſtand, &amp; apply it) the whole edifice built ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt be
ruinous and falſe. For if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect their bitter and continued diſcords
in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, without any meanes of agreement; they inſtantly tell
you (as <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> plainely ſhewes) that they differ only in
points not fundamentall. If you conuince them, euen by their owne
Confeſſions, that the ancient Fathers taught diuers points held by the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church againſt Proteſtants; they reply, that 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20773:43"/>thoſe Fathers may neuertheles be ſaued, becauſe
thoſe errors were not fundamentall. If you will them to remember, that
Chriſt muſt alwayes haue a viſible Church on earth, with
admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Sacraments, and ſucceſſion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and that
when <hi>Luther</hi> appeared there was no Church diſtinct from the Roman,
whoſe <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Doctrine, Luther</hi> then forſooke, and
for that cauſe muſt be guilty of <hi>Schiſme</hi> and <hi>Hereſy;</hi>
they haue an Anſwere (ſuch as it is) that the Catholique Church cannot
periſh, yet may erre in points not fundamentall, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Luther</hi> and other Proteſtants were obliged to forſake her for
ſuch errors, vnder paine of <hi>Damnation;</hi> as if (forſooth) it were
<hi>Damnable,</hi> to hold an error not <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> nor
<hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> If you wonder how they can teach, that both Catholiques,
and Proteſtants may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in their ſeuerall profeſſions; they
ſalue this contradiction, by ſaying, that we both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in all
fundamentall points of faith, which is inough for ſaluation. And yet, which
is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly ſtrange, they could neuer be induced to giue a Catalogue
what points in particular be fundamentall, but only by ſome generall
deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, or by referring vs to the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> without
determining, what points therein be fundamentall, or not fundamentall for the
matter; and in what ſenſe, they be, or be not ſuch: and yet concerning
the meaning of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers points contained, or reduced to the <hi>Creed,</hi> 
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:20773:44"/>they differ both from vs, and amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g themſelues. And
indeed, it being impoſſible for them to exhibite any ſuch Catalogue, the
ſaid diſtinction of points, although it were pertinent, and true, cannot
ſerue them to any purpoſe, but ſtill they muſt remaine vncertaine,
whether or not they diſagree from one another; from the ancient Fathers; and
from the Catholique Church, in points fundamentall: which is to ſay, they
haue no certainty, whether they enjoy the ſubſtance of Chriſtian Faith,
without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hope to be ſaued. But of this more heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And to the end, that what ſhall be ſayd concerning
this diſtinction, may be better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, we are to obſerue; that
there be two precepts, which concerne the vertue of fayth, or our obligation to
<hi>belieue</hi> diuine truths. The one is by Deuines called
<hi>Affirmatiue,</hi> wherby we are obliged to haue a poſitiue, explicite
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of ſome chiefe Articles of Chriſtian faith. The other is termed
<hi>Negatiue,</hi> which ſtrictly binds vs not to disbelieue, that is, not to
belieue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary of any one point ſufficiently repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to our
vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing, as reuealed, or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Almighty God The ſayd
<hi>Affirmatiue Precept</hi> (according to the nature of ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands)
inioynes ſome act to be performed, but not at all <hi>tymes,</hi> nor doth it
equally bind all ſorts of <hi>perſons,</hi> in reſpect of all
<hi>Obiects</hi> to be belieued. For <hi>obiects;</hi> we grant that ſome are
more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <pb n="79" facs="tcp:20773:44"/>to be explicitely, and ſeuerall
belieued then other: eyther becauſe they are in themſelues more great, and
weighty; or els in regard they inſtruct vs in ſome neceſſary
Chriſtian duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, our ſelues, or our Neyghbour. For
<hi>perſons;</hi> no doubt but ſome are obliged to know diſtinctly more
then others, by reaſon of their office, vocation, capacity or the like. For
<hi>tymes;</hi> we are not obliged to be ſtill in act of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing acts
of fayth, but according as ſeuerall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions permit, or require The
ſecond kind of precept called <hi>Negatiue,</hi> doth (according to the
nature of all ſuch commands) oblige <hi>vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally,</hi> all
<hi>perſons,</hi> in reſpect of all <hi>obiects;</hi> &amp; at all
<hi>tymes; ſemper &amp; pro ſemper,</hi> as Deuines ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke. This
generall doctrine will be more cleere by examples. I am not obliged to be
alwayes helping my Neighbour, becauſe the <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> precept of
<hi>Charity,</hi> bindeth onely in ſome particuler caſes: But I am alwayes
bound by a <hi>Negatiue</hi> precept, neuer to doe him any hurt, or wrong. I am
not alwayes bound to vtter what I know to be true: yet I am obliged, neuer to
ſpeake any one leaſt vntruth, agaynſt my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And (to come to our
preſent purpoſe) there is no <hi>Affirmatiue</hi> precept, commanding vs to
be at <hi>al times</hi> actually belieuing any <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>all</hi>
Articles of faith: But we are obliged, <hi>neuer</hi> to exerciſe any act
againſt any one truth, knowne to be reuealed. All ſorts of
<hi>perſons</hi> are not bound explicitely, and diſtinctly to know all
things te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified <pb n="80" facs="tcp:20773:45"/>by God either in Scripture, or
otherwiſe: but euery one is obliged, not to belieue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of any one
point, knowne to be teſtified by God. For that were in fact to affirme, that
God could be deceiued, or would deceiue; which were to ouer throw the whole
certainty of our faith, wherin the thing moſt principall, is not the point
which we belieue, which Deuines cal the <hi>Materiall Obiect,</hi> but the
chiefeſt is the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> for which we belieue, to wit, Almighty God's
infallible reuelation, or authority which they terme the <hi>Formall
obiect</hi> of our faith. In two ſenſes therefore, and with a double
relation, points of fayth may be called fundamentall, and neceſſary to
ſaluation. The one is taken with reference to the <hi>Affirmatiue</hi>
Precept, when the points are of ſuch quality that there is obligation to know
and belieue them expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely and ſeuerally. In this ſenſe we grant that
there is difference betwixt points of faith, which <hi>D: Potter</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Pag. <hi>209</hi>
                  </note> to no purpoſe laboureth to
proue againſt his Aduerſary, who in expreſſe words doth grant and
explicate<note n="(b)" place="margin">Charity Mistaken c. <hi>8.</hi> pag.
<hi>75.</hi>
                  </note> it. But the <hi>Doctor</hi> thought good to diſſemble
the matter, &amp; not ſay one pertinent word in defenſe of his
diſtinction, as it was impugned by <hi>Charity Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,</hi> and as it is
wont to be applied by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. The other ſenſe, according to which,
points of faith may be called <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> and neceſſary to
ſaluation, with reference to the <hi>Negatiue</hi> precept of faith, is
ſuch, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <pb n="81" facs="tcp:20773:45"/>not without grieuous ſinne, and
forfeiture of ſaluation, disbelieue any one point, ſufficiently propounded,
as reuealed by Almighty God. And in this ſenſe we auouch, that there is no
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction in points of faith, as if to reiect ſome muſt be damnable,
and to reiect others, equally propoſed as God's word, might ſtand with
ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Yea the obligation of the <hi>Negatiue</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is far more
ſtrict, then is that of the <hi>Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue,</hi> which God freely
impoſed, &amp; may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly releaſe. But it is impoſſible, that he can
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, or giue leaue to disbelieue, or deny what he affirmeth: and in
this ſenſe, ſinne &amp; damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are more inſeparable from
<hi>error</hi> in points <hi>not fundamentall,</hi> then from
<hi>ignorance</hi> in Articles <hi>fundamentall.</hi> All this I ſhew by an
Example, which I wiſh to be particularly noted for the preſent, and for
diuers other occaſions hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The <hi>Creed</hi> of the
<hi>Apostles</hi> containes diuers fundamentall points of faith, as the Deity,
Trinity of Perſons, Incarnation, Paſſion, and Reſurrection of our
Sauiour Chriſt &amp;c. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines alſo ſome points, for their matter,
and narure in themſelues not fundamentall, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Iudge our Sauiour
ſuffered, that he was buried, the circumſtance of the time of his
Reſurrection the third day &amp;c. But yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, whoſoeuer
once knowes that theſe points are contained in the Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi>
the deniall of them is damnable, and is in that ſenſe a
<hi>fundamentall</hi> error: &amp; this is the preciſe point 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20773:46"/>of the preſent queſtion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And all that hitherto hath been ſaid, is ſo
manifeſtly true, that no Proteſtant or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, if he do but
vnderſtand the termes, and ſtate of the Queſtion, can poſſibly deny
it: In ſo much as I am amazed, that men who otherwiſe are endued with
excellent wits, ſhould ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaue themſelues to their Predeceſſors
in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſme, as ſtil to harp on this diſtinction, &amp; neuer
regard how impertinently, and vntruly it was applyed by them at firſt, to
make all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſeeme to be of one fayth, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth they
agree in fundamentall points. For the difference among Proteſtants,
conſiſts not in that ſome belieue ſome points, of which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are
ignorant, or not bound expreſſely to know (as the diſtinction ought to be
applyed;) but that ſome of them disbelieue, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, wittingly, and
willingly oppoſe what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do belieue to be teſtifyed by the word of
God, wherein there is no difference betweene points fundamentall, and not
fundamentall; Becauſe till points fundamentall be ſufficiently propoſed
as reuealed by God, it is not agaynſt faith to reiect them, or rather without
ſufficient propoſition it is not poſſible prudently to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them;
and the like is of points not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, which aſſoone as they come to
be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propounded as diuine Truths, they can no more be denyed,
then points fundamentall propounded after the ſame manner. Neither wil 
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20773:46"/>it auayle them to their other end, that for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
of the Church in being, it is ſufficient that ſhe do not erre in poins
fundamentall. For if in the meane time ſhe maintaine any one Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
againſt Gods reuelation, be the thing in it ſelfe neuer ſo ſmall, her
Errour is damnable, and deſtructiue of ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But <hi>D. Potter</hi> forgetting to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Proteſtants make vſe of their diſtinction, doth finally ouer throw it,
&amp; yields to as much as we can deſire. For, ſpeaking of that
<hi>meaſure</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="margin">pag. <hi>211.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>and
quantity of faith without which none can be ſaued,</hi> he ſayth: <hi>It is
inough to belieue ſome things by a vertuall faith, or by a generall, and as
it were, a negatiue faith, whereby they are not denied or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.</hi>
Now our queſtion is in caſe that diuine truths, although not fundamentall,
be denied and contradicted; and therefore, euen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him, all ſuch
deniall excludes ſaluation. After, he ſpeakes more plainely. <hi>It is
true</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whatſoeuer</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">pag.
<hi>212.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>is reuealed in Scripture, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Church
out of Scripture, is in ſome ſenſe fundamentall, in regard of the diuine
authority of God, and his word, by which it is recommended: that is, ſuch as
may not be denied, or contradicted without Infidelity: ſuch as euery
Christian is bound with himility, and reuerence to belieue, whenſoeuer the
knowledge thereof is offered to him.</hi> And further: <hi>Where</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">pag. <hi>250.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the reuealed will or word of
God is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propounded; there he that oppoſeth, is conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of
error, and he who is thus conuinced is an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, <pb n="84" facs="tcp:20773:47"/>and
Hereſie is a worke of the fleſh which exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from heauen.</hi>
(<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20.21.) <hi>And hence it followeth, that it is FVNDAMENTALL to
a Christians FAITH, and neceſſary for his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he belieue all
reuealed Truths of God, whereof he may be conuinced that they are from
God.</hi> Can any thing be ſpoken more crearely or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly for vs, that it
is a <hi>Fundamentall</hi> error to deny any one point, though neuer ſo
ſmall, if once it be ſufficiently propounded, as a diuine truth, and that
there is, in this ſenſe, no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betwixt points fundamentall, and
not fundamentall? And if any ſhould chance to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that it is againſt
the foundation of faith, not to belieue points <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be not ſufficiently propounded, <hi>D. Potter</hi> doth not admit of
this<note n="(f)" place="margin">Pag. <hi>246.</hi>
                  </note> difference bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt
points fundamentall, and not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. For he teacheth, that
<hi>ſufficient propoſition of reuealed truth is required before a man can
be conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi> and for want of ſufficient conuiction he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth the
Diſciples from hereſy, although they belieued not our Sauiours
Reſurrection,<note n="(g)" place="margin">pag. <hi>246.</hi>
                  </note> which is a
very fundamentall point of faith. Thus then I argue out of <hi>D. Potters</hi>
owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſon: No error is damnable vnles the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth be
ſufficiently propounded as reuealed by God: Euery error is damnable, if the
contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth be ſufficiently propounded as reuealed by God: Therfore all
errors are alike for the generall effect of damnation, if the difference 
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20773:47"/>ariſe not from the manner of being propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And what
now is become of their diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
               <p n="5">5. I will therfore conclude with this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. According
to all Philoſophy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, the <hi>Vnity,</hi> and diſtinction of
euery thing followeth the Nature &amp; Eſſence thereof, and therfore if the
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>being</hi> of fayth, be not taken from the matter which
a man belieues, but from the motiue for which he belieues, (which is God's word
or Reuelation) we muſt likewiſe affirme that the <hi>Vnity,</hi> and
<hi>Diuerſity</hi> of faith, muſt be meaſured by God's reuelation (which
is alike for all obiects) and not by the ſmalnes, or greatnes of the matter
which we belieue. Now, that the nature of faith is not taken from the greatnes,
or ſmallnes of the things belieued, is manifeſt; becauſe otherwiſe one
who belieues only fundamentall points, and another who together with them, doth
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo belieue points not fundamentall, ſhould haue faith of different
natures, yea there ſhould be as many differences of faith, as there are
different points which men belieue, according to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t capacities, or
inſtruction &amp;c. all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences are abſurd, &amp; therfore we
muſt ſay, that <hi>Vnity in Fayth</hi> doth not depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> points
fundamentall, or not fundamentall, but vpon God's reuelation equally or
vnequally propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and Proteſtants pretending an <hi>Vnity</hi> only by
reaſon of their agreement in fundamentall <pb n="86" facs="tcp:20773:48"/>points, do
indeed induce as great a multiplicity of faith as there is multitude of
different ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects which are belieued by them, &amp; ſince they diſagree in
things <hi>Equally reuealed</hi> by Almighty God, it is euident that they
forſake the very <hi>Formall motiue</hi> of faith, which is Gods reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and conſequently looſe all <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> therin.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The firſt part of the Title of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>(That the distinction of points fundamentall &amp; not fundamentall in the
ſenſe of Protestants, is both impertinent and vntrue)</hi> being
demonſtrated; let vs now come to the ſecond: <hi>That the Church is
infallible in all her definitions, whether they concerne points fundamentall,
or not fundamentall.</hi> And this I proue by theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It hath beene ſhewed in the prcedent Chapter, that
the Church is Iudge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies in Religion; which ſhe could not be,
if ſhe could erre in any one point, as <hi>Doctor Potter</hi> would not deny,
if he were once perſuaded that ſhe is Iudge. Becauſe if ſhe could erre
in ſome points, we could not rely vpon her <hi>Authority</hi> and Iudgment in
any one thing.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This ſame is proued by the reaſon we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
before, that ſeeing the Church was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in all her definitions ere
Scripture was written (vnles we will take away all certainty of fayth for that
tyme) we cannot with any ſhew of reaſon affirme, that ſhe hath been
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued thereof by the adioined comfort, &amp; help <pb n="87" facs="tcp:20773:48"/>of
ſacred Writ.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Moreouer to ſay, that the Catholique Church may
propoſe any falſe doctrine, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her lyable to <hi>damnable</hi> ſinne
and errour; &amp; yet <hi>D. Potter</hi> teacheth that the Church cannot erre
<hi>damnably.</hi> For if in that kind of Oath, which Deuines call
<hi>Aſſertorium,</hi> wherin God is called to witnes, euery falſhood is a
deadly ſinne in any priuate perſon whatſoeuer, although the thing be of
it ſelfe neither materiall, nor preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to any; becauſe the quantity,
or greatnes of that ſinne is not meaſured ſo much by the thing which is
affirmed, as by the manner, &amp; authority whereby it is auouched, and by the
iniury that is offered to Almighty God in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying his teſtimony to a
falſhood: in which reſpect it is the vnanimous conſent of all Deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that in ſuch kind of Oaths, no <hi>leuitas mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> that is,
<hi>ſmallnes of matter,</hi> can excuſe from a mortall ſacriledge,
agaynſt the <hi>morall</hi> vertue of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which reſpects worſhip due
to God: If, I ſay, euery leaſt falſhood be deadly ſinne in the
foreſayd kind of Oath; much more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a ſinne muſt it be in the
<hi>publique perſon</hi> of the Catholique Church to propound vntrue Articles
of fayth, thereby faſtning Gods <hi>prime Verity</hi> to falſhood, and
inducing and obliging the world to doe the ſame. Beſids, according to the
doctrine of all Deuines, it is not only iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to Gods Eternall Verity, to
disbelieue things by him reuealed, but alſo to propoſe as 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20773:49"/>reuealed truths, thinges not reuealed: as in commonwealths
it is a haynous offence to coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne eyther by counterfeyting the mettall or the
ſtamp, or to apply the Kings ſeale to a writing counterfeyt, although the
contents were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be true. And whereas, to ſhew the deteſtable
ſinne of ſuch pernicious fictions, the Church doth moſt exemplarly
puniſh all broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of faygned reuelations, viſions, miracles, prophecies
&amp;c. as in particuler appeareth in the Councell of<note n="(h)" place="margin">Sub Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>10.</hi> Seſſ. <hi>11.</hi>

<hi>is high preſumption, almost as great as to detract fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it.</hi> And
therfore to ſay the Church may add falſe Reuelations, is to accuſe her of
high preſumption, and of pernicious errour excluding ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Perhaps ſome will heere reply that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the

               <p n="11">11. But it is eaſily demonſtrated that this excuſe
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſerue. For if the Church be aſſiſted only for points
fundamentall, ſhe cannot but know, that ſhe may erre in points not

&amp; therfore cannot be excuſed from headlong &amp; pernicious temerity, in
propoſing points not fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall, to be belieued by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as
matters of faith, wherin ſhe can haue no certainty, yea which alwayes imply a
fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood. For although the thing might chance to be true, and perhaps alſo
reuealed; yet for the <hi>matter</hi> ſhe, for her part, doth alwaies
expoſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to danger of falſhood &amp; error; and in fact doth
alwayes erre in the <hi>manner</hi> in which ſhe doth propound any matter not
fundamentall; becauſe ſhe propoſeth it as a point of faith
<hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> true, which yet is alwayes vncertaine, if ſhe in ſuch
things may be deceiued.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Beſides, if the Church may erre in points not

which is not ſuch: or els erre in keeping and conſeruing from corruptions
ſuch Scriptures as are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy belieued to be Canonicall. For I will
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that in ſuch Apocryphall Scripture as ſhe deliuers, there is
no fundamentall error againſt faith, or that there is no falſhood at all
but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly want of diuine teſtification in which caſe <hi>D. Potter</hi>
muſt either grant, that it is a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall <pb n="90" facs="tcp:20773:50"/>error, to
apply diuine reuelation to any point not reuealed, or els muſt yield, that
the Church may erre in her <hi>Propoſition,</hi> or <hi>Custody</hi> of the
Canon of Scripture: And ſo we cannot be ſure whether ſhe haue not been
deceiued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, in Bookes recommended by her, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by Chriſtians.
And thus we ſhall haue no certainty of Scripture, if the Church want
certainty in all her definitions. And it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be obſerued, that
ſome Bookes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which were not alwayes knowne to be Canonicall,
haue been afterward receiued for ſuch; but neuer any one Booke, or ſyllable
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the Church to be Canonicall, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward queſtioned, or
reiected for Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall. A ſigne, that God's Church is infallibly
aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt, neuer to propoſe as diuine truth, any
thing not reuealed by God: &amp; that, <hi>Omiſsion</hi> to define points not

                  <hi>directly, and primarily
made to the Apostles (who had the Spirits guidance in a more high and
abſolute manner, then any ſince them) yet it was made to them for the
behoofe of the Church, and is verified in the Church Vniuerſall. But all
truth is not ſimply all, but all of ſome kind. To be led into all truths,
is to know, and belieue them. And who is ſo ſimple as to be ignorant, that
there are many millions of truths (in Nature, Hiſtory, Diuinity) whereof the
Church is ſimply ignorant. How many truths lye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouealed in the infinite
treaſury of God's wiſdome, wherewith the Church is not acquainted &amp;c.
ſo then, the truth it ſelfe enforceth vs to vnderstand by (all truths) not

ſaluation.</hi> Marke what he ſayth. That promiſe <hi>(The ſpirit

the promiſe made to the Apoſtles of being led into all truth, is to be
vnderſtood only of all truth abſolutly neceſſary to ſaluation? &amp;
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently their preaching, and writing, were not infallible in points not
fundamentall? or if the Apoſtles were infallible in all things which they
propoſed as diuine truth, the like muſt be <pb n="93" facs="tcp:20773:51"/>affirmed of
the Church, becauſe <hi>D. Potter</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, the ſayd promiſe <hi>to
be verifyed in the Churh.</hi> And as he limits the aforeſayd wordes to
points fundamentall; ſo may he reſtrayne what other text ſoeuer that can
be brought for the vniuerſall infallibility of the Apoſtles or Seriptures.
So he may; and ſo he muſt, leaſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he receiue this anſwere
of his owne from himſeife, <hi>How many truths lye vnreuealed in the infinite
treaſury of Gods wiſdome, wherewith the Church is not acquainted?</hi> And
therefore to veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy ſuch generall ſayings, they muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequences? And yet <hi>D. Potter</hi> will neuer be able to auoyd them,
till he come to acknowledge the Infallibility of the Church in al points by her
propoſed as diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne truths; &amp; thus it is vniuerſally true that ſhe is
lead into al truth, in regard that our Sauiour ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer permits her to define, or
teach any falſhood.</p>
               <p n="14">14. All, that with any colour may be repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this
argument is; That if once we call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Booke, or parcell of Scripture in
que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; although for the matter it containe no fundamentall errour, yet it
is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and fundamentall, by reaſon of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce;
becauſe if once we doubt of one Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke receiued for Canonicall, the whole
Canon is made doubtfull and vncertayne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Infallibility of
Scripture muſt be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall, and not confined within compaſſe of 
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20773:52"/>points fundamentall.</p>
               <p n="15">15. I anſwere: For the thing it ſelfe it is very
true, that if I doubt of any one parcell of Scripture receaued for ſuch, I
may doubt of all: And thence by the ſame parity I inferre, that if we did
doubt of the Churches Infallibility in ſome points, we could not belieue her
in any one, and conſequently not in propounding <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall</hi> Bookes,
or any other points fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, or not fundamentall; which thing being
moſt abſurd, and withall moſt impious, we muſt take away the ground
thereof, &amp; belieue that ſhe cannot erre in any point great or ſmall:
and ſo this reply doth much more ſtrengthen what we intended to proue. Yet
I add, that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants cannot make vſe of this reply, with any good
coherence to this their diſtinction, and ſome other doctrines which they
defend. For if <hi>D. Potter</hi> can tell what points in particuler be
fundamentall (as in his 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> he pretendeth) then he may be ſure,
that whenſoeuer he meets with ſuch points in Scripture, in them it is
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly <hi>true,</hi> although it might erre in others: &amp; not only
<hi>true,</hi> but <hi>cleere,</hi> becauſe Proteſtants teach, that in
matters neceſſary to Saluation, the Scripture is ſo cleere, that all
ſuch neceſſary Truths are eyther manifeſtly contayned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or may
be cleerely deduced from it. Which doctrines being put togeather, to wit: That
Scriptures cannot erre in points fundamentall; that they cleerely containe all
ſuch points; and <pb n="95" facs="tcp:20773:52"/>that they can tell what points in
particuler be ſuch, I meane fundamentall; it is manifeſt, that it is
ſuſſicie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for Saluation, that Scripture be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible only in points
fundamentall. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing theſe doctrines of theirs to be true, they
may be ſure to find in Scripture all points ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſaluation,
although it were fallible in other points of leſſe moment. Neyther will
they be able to auoyde this impiety againſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, till they
renounce their other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines: and in particuler, till they belieue that
Chriſts promiſes to his Church, are not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to points
fundamentall.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Beſides, from the fallibility of Chriſts
Catholique Church in ſome points, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that no true Proteſtant
learned, or vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, doth or can with aſſurance belieue the
v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall Church in any one point of doctrine. Not in points of leſſer
mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which they call <hi>not fundamentall;</hi> becauſe they belieue that
in ſuch points ſhe may erre. Not in <hi>fundamentalls;</hi> becauſe they
muſt know what points be funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, before they go to learne of her,
leaſt other wiſe they be rather deluded, then inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; in regard that
her certaine, and infallible direction extends only to points fundamentall.
Now, if before they addreſſe themſelues to the Church, they muſt know
what points are fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, they learne not of her, but will be be as fit to
teach, as to be taught by her: How then are all Chriſtians ſo often, ſo
ſeriouſly, <pb n="96" facs="tcp:20773:53"/>vpon ſo dreadfull menaces, by Fathers,

becauſe Scripture it ſelfe recommends the Church; and therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on

Yet if he will needs hold, that this point is not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, we muſt
conclude out of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> (as we did concerning the baptizing of

heauy vpon <hi>Charity Mistaken,</hi> becauſe he demands a particuler

whether or no, he haue fayth ſufficient to Saluation. And therefore take it
not in ill part, if we agayne and agayne demand ſuch a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. And that
you may ſee we proceed faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I will performe, on our behalfe, what we
requeſt of you, &amp; do heer deliuer a Catalogue, wherein are comprized all
points by vs taught to be neceſſary to Saluation, in theſe wordes: <hi>We
are obliged, vnder payne of damnation, to belieue whatſoeuer the Catholique
viſible Church of Christ propoſeth, as renealed by Almighty God.</hi> If
any be <pb n="107" facs="tcp:20773:58"/>of another mind, all Catholiques denounce him to be
no Catholique. But inough of this. And I go forward with the Infallibility of
the Church in all points.</p>
               <p n="20">20. For, euen out of your owne doctrine that the Church
cannot erre in points neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſaluation, any wiſe man will infer,
that it behooues all, who haue care of their ſoules, not to forſake her in
any one point. 1. Becauſe they are aſſured, that although her doctrine
proued not to be true in ſome point, yet euen according to <hi>D.
Potter,</hi> the error cannot be fundamentall, nor deſtructiue of fayth, and
ſaluation: neither can they be accuſed of any leaſt imprudence in erring
(if it were poſſible) with the vniuerſall Church. Secondly, ſince ſhe
is, vnder paine of eternall damnation, to be belieued, and obeyed in ſome
things, wherin confeſſedly ſhe is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with infallibility; I cannot
in wiſdome ſuſpect her credit in matters of leſſe moment. For who
would truſt another in matters of higheſt conſequence, and be afraid to
rely on him in things of leſſe moment? Thirdly, ſince (as I ſaid) we
are vndoubtedly obliged not to forſake her in the chiefeſt, or fundamentall
points, and that there is no Rule to know preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely what, and how many
thoſe fundamentall points be; I cannot without hazard of my ſoule, leaue
her in any one point, leſt perhaps that point or points wherin I forſake
her, proue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be fundamentall, and neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. 
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20773:59"/>Fourthly, that viſible Church which can not erre in
points fundamentall, doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction, propound all her Definitions
concerning matters of faith to be belieued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Anathema's or Curſes,
eſteeming all thoſe who reſiſt, to be deſeruedly caſt out of her
Communion, and holding it as a point neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſaluation, that we
belieue ſhe cannot erre: wherin if ſhe ſpeake true, then to deny any one
point in <hi>particuler,</hi> which ſhe defineth, or to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme in
<hi>generall,</hi> that ſhe may erre, puts a man into ſtate of damnation.
Wheras to belieue her in ſuch points as are not neceſſary to
ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can not endanger ſaluation; as likewiſe to remaine in her
Communion, can bring no great harme, becauſe ſhe cannot maintaine any
damnable error, or practiſe: but to be deuided fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her (ſhe being
Chriſts Catholique Church) is moſt certainely damnable. Fifthly, the true
Church, being in lawfull, and certaine poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Superiority and
Power, to command &amp; require Obedience, from all Chriſtians in ſome
things; I cannot without grieuous ſinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my obedience in any one,
vnles I euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, that the thing commanded comes not within the
compaſſe of thoſe things to which her Power extendeth. And who can better
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme me, how far God's Church can proceed, then God's Church herſelfe? Or
to what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor can the Children, and Schoollers, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon, and
more ſecurity, fly for direction, <pb n="109" facs="tcp:20773:59"/>then to the
<hi>Mother,</hi> and appointed <hi>Teacher</hi> of all Chriſtians? In
following her, I ſhall ſooner be excuſed, then in cleauing to any
particuler Sect, or Perſon, teaching, or applying Scriptures againſt her
doctrine, or interpretation. Sixtly, the fearefull examples of innumerable
perſons who forſaking the Church vpon pretence of her errours, haue failed,
euen in fundamentall points, and ſuffered ſhip wracke of their Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ought to deter all Chriſtians, from oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her in any one doctrine, or
practiſe: as (to omit other, both ancient and moderne hereſies) we ſee
that diuers chiefe Proteſtants, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reforme the corruptions of the
Church, are come to affirme, that for many Ages, ſhe erred to death, and
wholy periſhed; which <hi>D. Potter,</hi> cannot deny to be a fundamentall
Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour againſt that Article of our Creed, <hi>I belieue the Catholike
Church,</hi> as he affirmeth it of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> becauſe they
confined the vniuerſall Church within <hi>Afirica,</hi> or ſome other
ſmall tract of ſoile. Leaſt therefore I may fall into ſome fundamentall
errour, it is moſt ſafe for me to belieue al the Decrees of that Church,
which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not erre fundamentally: eſpecially if we add; That according to the
Doctrine of Catholique Deuines, one errour in fayth, whether it be for the
matter if ſelfe, great or ſmall, deſtroyes fayth, as is hewed in
<hi>Charity Mistaken;</hi> and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to accuſe the Church of any
one Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, is to affirme, that the loſt all fayth, and <pb n="111" facs="tcp:20773:60"/>erred damnably: which very ſaying is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe at leaues
Chriſt no viſible Church on earth.</p>
               <p n="21">21. To all theſe arguments I add this demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration:
<hi>D. Potter</hi> teacheth, that <hi>there neyther was</hi>

                  <hi>nor can be any iust cauſe
to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church of Chriſt, no more then from Christ
himſelfe.</hi> But if the Church of Chriſt can erre in ſome points of
fayth, men not only may, but muſt forſake her in thoſe, (vnles <hi>D.
Potter</hi> will haue them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue one thing, and profeſſe another:)
and if ſuch errours, and corruptions ſhould fall out to be about the
Churches Liturgy, publique Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, adminiſtration of Sacraments, &amp; the
like; they who perceiue ſuch errours, muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity leaue her
externall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if once we grant the Church may erre, it
followeth that men may, and ought to forſake her (which is againſt <hi>D.
Potters</hi> owne wordes,) or elſe they are inexcuſable who left the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, vnder pretence of Errors, which they
grant, not to be funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall. And if <hi>D. Potter</hi> thinke good to
anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were this argument, he muſt remember his owne doctrine to be, that euen
the <hi>Catholique</hi> Church may erre in points not fundamentall.</p>
               <p n="22">22. An other argument for the vniuerſall infallibility
of the Church, I take out of <hi>D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> owne words. <hi>If</hi>

could not agree with the Church truly <pb n="112" facs="tcp:20773:60"/>Catholique.</hi>
Theſe words cannot be true, vnleſſe he preſuppoſe that the <hi>Church
truly Catholique,</hi> cannot erre in points not fundamentall. For if ſhe may
erre in ſuch points, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church which he affirmeth to erre
only in points <hi>not fundamentall,</hi> may agree with the <hi>Church truly
Catholique,</hi> if ſhe likewiſe may erre in points <hi>not

contradiction in his owne words, or elſe muſt grant, that the <hi>Church
truly Catholique</hi> cannot erre in points <hi>not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> which
is what we intended to proue.</p>
               <p n="23">23. If <hi>Words</hi> cannot perſwade you, that in all

                  </note> limits theſe promiſes &amp; priuiledges to
<hi>fundamentall</hi> points, in which he grants the Church cannot erre. I vrge
the wordes of Scripture, which are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall, and doe not mention any
ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. I alleadge that moſt reaſonable, and receaued Rule,
that Scripture is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood literally, as it ſoundeth, vnleſſe
ſome manifeſt abſurdity force vs to the contrary. But all will not
ſerue, to accord our different interpretations. In the meane tyme diuers of
<hi>Doctor Potters</hi> Brethren ſteppe in, and reiect his limitation, as
ouer large, and ſom what taſting of Papiſtry: And therfore they
reſtraine the mentioned Texts, either to the Infallibility 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20773:61"/>which the Apoſtles, and other ſacred Writers had in
penning of Scripture: or elſe to the <hi>inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> Church of the
<hi>Elect;</hi> and to them, not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, but with a double
reſtriction, that they ſhall not fall <hi>damnably,</hi> &amp;
<hi>finally;</hi> and other men haue as much right as theſe, to interpoſe
their opinion, &amp; interpretation. Behold we are three at debate about the
ſelfe ſame words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: We confer diuers places and Text: We
conſult the Originals: We examine Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: We endeauour to pray
hartily: We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to ſpeake ſincerely; To ſeeke nothing but truth
and ſaluation of our owne ſoules, &amp; that of our Neighbours; and finally
we vſe all thoſe meanes, which by Proteſtants themſelues are
preſcribed for finding out the true meaning of Scripture: Neuertheles we
neither do, or haue any poſſible meanes to agree, as long as we are left to
our ſelues; and when we ſhould chance to be agreed, the doubt would ſtill
remaine whether the thing it ſelfe be a <hi>fundamentall</hi> point or no:
And yet it were great impiety to imagine that God, the Louer of ſoules, hath
left no certaine infallible meanes, to decide both this, and all other
differences ariſing about the interpretation of Scripture, or vpon any other
occaſion. Our remedy therfore in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions muſt be, to
conſult, and heare God's Viſible Church, with ſubmiſſiue
acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Power, and Infallibility in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhe
propoſeth as a reuealed truth: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <pb n="114" facs="tcp:20773:62"/>to that diuine

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes all points neceſſary to
be belieued. Be it ſo. But doth it likewiſe containe all points not to be
disbelieued? Certainly it doth nor. For how many truths are there in holy
Scripture not contayned in the Creed, which we are not obliged diſtinctly,
and particulerly to know &amp; belieue, but are bound vnder paine of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not to reiect, as ſoone as we come to know that they are found in holy
Scripture? And we hauing already ſhewed, that whatſoeuer is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed 
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20773:63"/>by Gods Church as a point of fayth, is infallibly a truth
reuealed by God; it followeth that whoſoeuer denyeth any ſuch point,
oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Gods ſacred teſtimony, whether that point be contayned in the
Creed, or no. In vaine then was your care imploied to proue that al points of
fayth neceſſary to be <hi>explicitely</hi> belieued, are contained in the
Creed. Neyther was that the Catalogue which <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> demanded.
His demand was (and it was moſt reaſonable) that you would once giue vs a
liſt of all funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, the denyall whereof deſtroyes Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
whereas the denyall of other points not fundamentall, may ſtand with
ſaluation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though both theſe kinds of points be equally propoſed as
reuealed by God. For if they be not equally propoſed, the difference will
ariſe from diuerſity of the <hi>Propoſall,</hi> and not of the
<hi>Matter</hi> fundamentull, or not fundamentall. This Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue only, can
ſhew how farre Proteſtants may diſagree without breach of Vnity in fayth;
and vpon this many other matters depend, according to the ground of
Proteſtants. But you will neuer aduenture to publiſh ſuch a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue. I
ſay more: You cannot aſſigne any one point ſo <hi>great,</hi> or
fundamentall, that the denyall thereof will make a man an Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, if it be
not ſufficiently propounded, as a diuine Truth: Nor can you aſſigne any
one point ſo <hi>ſmall,</hi> that it can without hereſy be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, if
once it be ſufficiently repreſented as <pb n="117" facs="tcp:20773:63"/>reuealed by
God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nay, this your inſtance in the Creed, is not only
impertinent but directly agaynſt you. For, all points in the Creed are not of
their own nature fundamentall, as I ſhewed<note n="(a)" place="margin">Chap.

                  </note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And yet it is damnable to deny any
one point contayned in the Creed. So that it is cleere, that to make an errour
damnable, it is not neceſſary that the matter be of it ſelfe
fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreouer you cannot ground any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty vpon the
Creed it ſelfe, vnleſſe firſt you preſuppoſe that the authority of
the Church is vniuerſally infallible, and conſequently that it is damnable
to oppoſe her declarations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they concerne matters great, or ſmall,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

which you ſay were out of <pb n="118" facs="tcp:20773:64"/>the Scriptures, <hi>ſummed,

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and not one pretermitted, altered, or miſtaken, vnleſſe we
vndoubtedly know that the Apoſtles compoſed the Creed; and <hi>that</hi>
they intended to contract all fundamentall points of faith into it; or at
leaſt <hi>that the Church of their tymes</hi> (for it ſeemeth you doubt
whether indeed it were compoſed by the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues) did
vnderſtand the Apoſtles aright; &amp; <hi>that the Church of their
tymes,</hi> did intend that the Creed ſhould containe all fundamentall
points. For if the Church may erre in points not fundamentall, may ſhe not
alſo erre in the particulers which I haue ſpecifyed? Can you ſhew it to
be a fundamentall point of fayth, that the Apoſtles intended to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prize all
points of fayth neceſſary to Saluation in the Creed? Your ſelfe ſay no

                  <hi>probable;</hi> which is farre from reaching to a
fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall point of fayth. Your probability is grounded vpon <hi>the
Iudgment of Antiquity, and euen of the Roman Doctours,</hi> as you ſay in the
ſame place. But if the Catholique Church may erre, what certainty can you
expect from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, or Doctours? Scripture is <hi>your</hi> totall Rule of
fayth. Cite therefore ſome Text of Scripture, to proue that the Apoſtles,
or <hi>the Church of their tymes</hi> compoſed the Creed, and compoſed it
with a purpoſe that it ſhonld con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne all fundamentall points of fayth.
Which <pb n="119" facs="tcp:20773:64"/>being impoſſible to be done, you muſt for the
Creed it ſelfe rely vpon the infallibility of the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreouer, the Creed conſiſteth not ſo much in the
words, as in their ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. All ſuch as pretend to the name of
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, recite the Creed, &amp; yet many haue erred fundamentally, as
well againſt the Articles of the Creed as other points of faith. It is then
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry friuolous to ſay, the Creed containes all fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points, without
ſpecifying, both in what ſenſe the Articles of the Creed be
<hi>true,</hi> and alſo in what <hi>true</hi> ſenſe, they be
<hi>fundamental.</hi> For, both theſe taskes, you are to performe, who teach
that all truth is not fundamentall: &amp; you do but delude the ignorant, when

not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: for ſo it were neceſſary to ſaluation that all
Chriſtians ſhould know the whole Scripture, wherin euery leaſt point hath
a <hi>Catholique ſenſe.</hi> Or if by Catholique ſenſe, you
vnderſtand that ſenſe which is ſo vniuerſally to be knowne, and
belieued by all, that whoſoeuer failes therein cannot be ſaued, you trifle
and ſay no more then this: <hi>All points of the Creed in a ſenſe
neceſsary to ſaluation, are neceſsary to ſaluation.</hi> Or: <hi>All
points fundamentall, are fundamentall.</hi> After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it were an
eaſy thing to make many true Prognoſtications, by ſaying it will
certainely <pb n="120" facs="tcp:20773:65"/>raine, when it raineth. You ſay the

how ſhall we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the other <hi>parts,</hi> not explaned in thoſe

               <p n="5">5. For what Article in the Creed is more fundamentall, or
may ſeeme more cleere, then that, wherin we belieue IESVS-CHRIST to be the

Article, how many different do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are there, not only of old Heretiques,
as <hi>Arius, Nestorius, Eutiches &amp;c.</hi> but alſo of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
partly againſt Catholiques, and partly againſt one another? For the ſaid
maine Article of Chriſt's being the <hi>only</hi> Sauiour of the world
&amp;c. according to different ſenſes of diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sects, doth inuolue
theſe, and many other ſuch queſtions; That Faith in IESVS-CHRIST doth

yea no Biſhop by diuine Ordinance; No Reall preſence, no
Tranſubſtantiation, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others. And why? Becauſe (forſooth)
theſe Doctrines derogate from the Titles of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Redeemer, Aduocate,
Foundation &amp;c. Yea and are againſt the truth of our Sauiours hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

Tranſubſtantiation. Let then any iudicious man conſider, whether
<hi>Doctour Potter,</hi> or others doe really ſatisfy, when they ſend men
to the Creed for a perfect Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, to diſtinguiſh points fundamentall,
from thoſe which they ſay are not fundamentall. If he will ſpeake indeed
to ſome purpoſe, let him ſay: This Article is vnderſtood in this
ſenſe: and in this ſenſe it is fundamentall. That other is to be vnder
ſtood in ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yet according to that meaning, it is not ſo
fundamentall, but that men may diſagree, and deny it without damnation. But
it were no policy for any Proteſtant to deale ſo plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But to what end ſhould we vſe many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments? Euen

ouerthroweth your Aſſertion. For as the Apoſtles Creed was not to vs a

and not fundamentall points.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I come to the ſecond part: <hi>That the Creed doth
not containe all maine and principall points of faith.</hi> And to the end we
may not ſtriue about things either granted by vs both, or nothing concerning

               <p n="8">8. Firſt: That it cannot be denied, but that the Creed
is moſt full and complete, to that purpoſe for which the holy Apoſtles,
inſpir'd by God, meant that it ſhould ſerue, and in that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner as they
did intend it, which was, not to comprehend all particular points of faith, but
ſuch generall heads, as were moſt befitting, and requiſite for preaching
the faith of Chriſt to Iewes, and Gentiles, and might be briefly, and
compendiouſly ſet downe, and eaſily learned, and remembred. And therfore,
in reſpect of Gentiles, the Creed doth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion God, as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all
things; and for both Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, the Trinity, the Meſſias, and

glory, from whom they were to hope remiſſion of ſinnes, &amp; life
euerlaſting, and by whoſe ſacred Name they were to be diſtinguiſhed
from all other profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by being called Chriſtians. According to
which purpoſe <hi>S. Thomas of Aquine</hi>

<hi>g.</hi> 1. <hi>art.</hi> 8.</note> doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh all the Articles
of the Creed into theſe generall heads: That ſome belong to the Maieſty
of the <hi>Godhead;</hi> others to the Miſtery of our Sauiour Chriſts
<hi>Humane nature:</hi> Which two generall obiects of faith, the holy Ghoſt
doth expreſſe, and conioyne <hi>Ioan.</hi> 17. <hi>Haec est vita aterna
&amp;c. This is life euerlasting, that they know thee true GOD, and whom thou
hast ſent IESVS CHRIST.</hi> But it was not their meaning to giue vs as it

ſhould require, by their owne word or writing, for their time, and
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by their Succeſſours in the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Church. Our queſtion
then is not, whether the Creed be perfect, as far as the end for which it was
compoſed, did require; For we belieue &amp; are ready to giue our liues for
this: but only we deny, that the Apoſtles did intend to comprize therin all
particular points of beliefe, neceſſary to ſaluation, as euen by <hi>D.
Potters</hi> owne<note n="(i)" place="margin">

and dutyes <pb n="124" facs="tcp:20773:67"/>of Charity, which we are obliged not only to
practiſe, but alſo to <hi>beliene</hi> by diuine infallible fayth. Will he
therefore inferre that the Creed is not perfect, becauſe it contaynes not all
thoſe neceſſary, and fundamentall Obiects of fayth? He will anſwere.
No: becauſe the Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to expreſſe <hi>credenda,</hi>
thinges to be belieued, not practiſed. Let him therefore giue vs leaue to
ſay, that the Creed is perfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it wanteth none of thoſe Obiects
of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe which were intended to be ſet downe, as we explicated before.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The ſecond obſeruation is, that to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our
queſtion what points in particuler be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fundamentall, it will not be
ſufficient to alledg the Creed, vnleſſe it containe all ſuch points
eyther expreſſely &amp; immediatly; or els in ſuch manner, that by
euident, and neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they may be deduced from Articles
both cleerely, and particulerly contayned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For if the deduction be
<hi>doubtfull,</hi> we ſhal not be <hi>ſure,</hi> that ſuch Concluſions
be fundamental: or if the Articles themſelues which are ſayd to be
fundamentall, be not diſtinctly, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly expreſſed, they will
not ſerue vs to know, and diſtinguiſh all points fundamental, from
thoſe which they call, not fundamentall. We doe not deny, but that all points
of fayth, both fundamentall, and not fundamentall, may be ſaid to be
contained in the Creed in ſome ſenſe; as for example, implicitely,
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, <pb n="125" facs="tcp:20773:67"/>or in ſome ſuch inuolued manner. For when
we explicitely belieue the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> we do implicitely
belieue whatſoeuer ſhe propoſeth as belonging to faith. Or elſe by way
of <hi>reduction,</hi> that is, when we are once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the beliefe
of particular points of faith, not expreſſed, nor by neceſſary

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20773:68"/>was not a Communion of Saints, before the Bleſſed
Sacrament was inſtituted. Yet it is true, that after we know, and belieue,
there is ſuch a Sacrament, we may referre it to ſome of thoſe heads
expreſſed in the Creed, and yet ſo, as <hi>S. Thomas</hi> referrs it to
one Article, and <hi>D. Potter</hi> to another; and in reſpect of different
analogies or effects, it may be referred to ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Articles. The like I
ſay of other points of faith, which may in ſome ſort be reduced to the
Creed, but nothing to <hi>D. Potters</hi> purpoſe: But contrarily it
ſheweth, that your affirming ſuch and ſuch points to be fundamentall or

neceſſity, and your occaſions may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Which was an old cuſtome

diligently esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by the whole authority of the Church, their errour may
be borne with: but it muſt not paſſe ſo far as to attempt to ſhake
the foundation of the Church.</hi> We ſee <hi>S. Augustine</hi> places the
being of a point fundamentall or not fundamentall, in that it hath beene
<hi>examined,</hi> and <hi>established</hi> by the Church, although the point
of which he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <pb n="127" facs="tcp:20773:68"/>namely Originall Sinne, be not
contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Creed.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Out of that which hath beene ſayd, I inferre, that
<hi>Doctour Potters</hi> paines in alledging Catholique Doctours, the ancient
Fathers, and the Councell of Trent, to proue that the Creed containes all
points of faith, was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſince we grant it in manner aforeſayd.
But <hi>Doctour Potter,</hi> can not in his conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that
Catholique Deuines, or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent, and the holy Fathers did intend,
that all points in particuler which we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to belieue, are contayned
explicitely in the Creed; he knowing well inough, that all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques hold
themſelues obliged, to belieue all thoſe points which the ſayd Councell
defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to be belieued vnder an Anathema, and that all Chriſtians belieue
the commandments, Sacraments &amp;c. which are not expreſſed in the
Creed.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Neither muſt this ſeeme ſtrange. For who is
ignorant, that Summaries, Epitom'es, &amp; the like briefe Abſtracts, are not
intended to ſpecify all particulars of that Science, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to which
they belong. For as the Creed is ſaid to containe all points of
<hi>Fayth;</hi> ſo the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue comprehends all Articles, (as I may terme
them) which concerne <hi>Charity,</hi> and good life: and yet this cannot be
ſo vnderſtood, as if we were diſobliged from performance of any duty, or
the eſchewing of any vice, vnleſſe it be <pb n="128" facs="tcp:20773:69"/>expreſſed in the ten Commandments. For, (to omit the precepts of
receauing Sacraments, which belong to practiſe, or manners, and yet are not
contained in the Decalogue) there are many ſinnes, euen againſt the Law of
nature, and light of reaſon, which are not contained in the ten Commandments,
except only by ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, analogy, reduction, or ſome ſuch way. For
example, we find not expreſſed in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, either diuers ſinnes,
as Gluttony, Drunkenneſſe, Pride, Sloth, Couetouſnes in deſiring either
things ſuperfluous, or with too much greedines; or diuers of our chiefe
obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, as Obedience to Princes, and all Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, not only
Eccleſiaſticall but alſo Ciuill, whoſe Lawes <hi>Luther, Melancthon,
Caluin,</hi> and ſome other Proteſtants do dangerouſly affirme not to
oblige in conſcience, and yet theſe men thinke they know the ten
Commandments: as likewiſe diuers Proteſtants defend Vſury, to be lawfull;
and the many Treatiſes of <hi>Ciuilians, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists,</hi> and
<hi>Caſuists,</hi> are witneſſes, that diuers ſinnes againſt the
light of reaſon, and Law of nature are not diſtinctly expreſſed in the
ten Commandements; although when by other diligences they are found to be
vnlawfull, they may be reduced to ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and yet not ſo
euidently, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, but that diuers doe it in diuers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p n="12">12. My third Obſeruation is: That our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent 
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20773:69"/>queſtion being, whether or no the Creed containe ſo
fully all fundamentall points of faith, that whoſoeuer do not agree in all,
and euery one of thoſe fundamentall Articles, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue the ſame
ſubſtance of faith, nor hope of Saluation; if I can produce one, or more
points, not contained in the Creed, in which if two do not agree, both of them
cannot expect to be ſaued, I ſhall haue performed as much as I intend; and
<hi>D. Potter</hi> muſt ſeeke out ſome other Catalogue for points
fundamentall, then the Creed. Neither is it materiall to the ſaid pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
whether ſuch fundamentall points reſt only in knowledge, and ſpeculation
or beliefe, or elſe be further referred to work and practiſe. For the
<hi>Habit,</hi> or Vertue of <hi>Fayth,</hi> which incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and enableth vs
to belieue both ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and practicall verities, is of one and the
ſelfe ſame nature, and eſſence. For example, by the ſame
<hi>Fayth,</hi> wherby I ſpeculatiuely belieue there is a God, I likewiſe
belieue, that he is to be adored, ſerued, and loued, which belong to
pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. The reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Formall Obiect,</hi> or motiue,
for which I yield aſſent to thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſorts of materiall
obiects, is the ſame in both, to wit, the reuelation, or word of God. Where
by the way I note, that if the <hi>Vnity,</hi> or <hi>Distinction,</hi> and
nature of Fayth, were to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the diuerſity of things reuealed, by
one Fayth I ſhould belieue ſpeculatiue verities, and by another ſuch as
tend to practiſe, which <pb n="130" facs="tcp:20773:70"/>I doubt whether <hi>D.
Potter</hi> himſelfe will admit.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Hence it followeth, that whoſoeuer deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any one
maine practicall reuealed truth, is no leſſe an Heretique, then if he
ſhould deny a point reſting in beliefe alone. So that when <hi>D.
Potter,</hi> (to auoid our argument, that all funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points are not
contained in the Creed, becauſe in it there is no mention of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
which yet are points of ſo maine importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that Proteſtants make the due
adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them to be neceſſary &amp; eſſentiall to
conſtitute a Church) anſwereth, that the <hi>Sacraments are to be</hi>
                  <note n="(p)" place="margin">pag. <hi>235.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>reckoned, rather among
the</hi> Agenda <hi>of the Church, then the</hi> Credenda; <hi>they are rather
diuine rites &amp; ceremonies, then Doctrines,</hi> he either grants what we
affirme, or in effect ſayes; Of two kinds of reuealed truths, which are
neceſſary to be belieued, the Creed containes one ſort only,
<hi>ergo,</hi> it containes all kind of reuealed truths ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be
belieued. Our queſtion is not, <hi>de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> but <hi>re;</hi> not what
be called points of Fayth, or of practiſe, but what points indeed be
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily to be belieued, whether they be termed <hi>Agenda,</hi> or
<hi>Credenda:</hi> eſpecially the chiefeſt part of Chriſtian perfection
conſiſting more in Action, then in barren Speculation; in good workes, then
bare beliefe; in doing, then knowing. And there are no leſſe contentions
concerning practicall, then ſpeculatiue truths: as Sacraments, obtayning
remiſſion of ſinne, Inuocation of Saints, Prayers for dead, Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20773:70"/>of Chriſt in the Sacrament, &amp; many other: all which
do ſo much the more import, as on them, beſide right beliefe, doth alſo
depend our practiſe, and the ordering of our life. Though <hi>D. Potter</hi>
could therfore giue vs (as he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to do) a minute, and exact
Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue of all truths to be belieued; that would not make me able inough to
know, whether or no I haue faith ſufficient for ſaluation; till he alſo
did bring in a particular Liſt, of all belieued truths, which tend to
practiſe, declaring which of them be fundamentall, which not, that ſo euery
man might know whether he be not in ſome <hi>Damnable</hi> Errour, for ſome
Article of fayth, which further might giue influence into <hi>Damnable</hi>
works.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Theſe Obſeruations being premiſed, I come to
proue, that the Creed doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all points of Fayth neceſſary to
be knowne, &amp; belieued. And, to omit that in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall it doth not tell vs,
what points be funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, or not fundamentall, which in the way of
Proteſtants, is moſt neceſſary to be knowne; in particular, there is no
mention of the greateſt Euils, from which mans calamity proceeded, I meane,
the ſinne of the Angels, of <hi>Auam,</hi> and of Originall ſinne in vs:
not of the greateſt good from which we expect all good, to wit, the
neceſſity of <hi>Grace</hi> for all works ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to piety. Nay, there is

is with Proteſtants an eſſentiall Note of the Church. There is nothing
for Baptiſme of Children, nor againſt Rebaptization. There is no mention in
fauour, or againſt the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, of Power in the Church to
inſtitute Rites, Holy dayes &amp;c. and to inflict Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, or other

proceſſion of the holy Ghoſt from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Sonne; of
Purgatory, or Prayer for the dead, in any ſenſe: And yet <hi>D. Potter</hi>
doth not deny, but that <hi>Aerius</hi> was eſteemed an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique, for

points controuerted betwixt Proteſtants themſelues, and betweene
Ptote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants and Catholiques, which to <hi>D. Potter</hi> ſeeme ſo
haynous corruptions, that they cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out damnation ioyne with vs in
profeſſion therof. There is no mention of the Ceſſation of the Old Law,
which yet is a very maine point of faith. And many other might be alſo
added.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But what need we labour to ſpecify particulars?
There are as many importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t points of faith not expreſſed in the Creed, as
ſince the worlds beginning now, &amp; for all future times, there haue been,
are, and may be innumerable, groſſe, damnable, Hereſies, whoſe contrary
truths are not contained in the Creed. For, euery fundamental Error muſt haue
a contrary fundamentall truth; becauſe of two contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory propoſitions,
in the ſame degree, the one is falſe, the other muſt be true. As for
example, if it be a damnable error to <hi>deny</hi> the Bl. Trinity, or the
God-head of our Sauiour, the <hi>beliefe</hi> of them muſt be a truth
neceſſary to ſaluation; or rather, if we will ſpeake properly, the
<hi>Error</hi> is damnable, becauſe the oppoſite <hi>Truth</hi> is
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as death is frightfull, becauſe life is ſweet; and
according to Philoſophy, the Priuation is meaſured by the Forme to which it
is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. If therfore the Creed containe in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler 
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:20773:72"/>all fundamentall points of fayth, it muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely,
or by cleere conſequence, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend all truths oppoſite to innumerable
Hereſies of all Ages paſt, preſent, and to come, which no man in his wits
will affirme it to doe.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And heer I cannot omit to ſignify how you<note n="(s)" place="margin">pag. <hi>255.</hi>
                  </note> applaude the ſaying of <hi>D.
Vſher. That in thoſe Propoſitions which without all controuerſy are

eſpied a foule contradiction in the ſaid words of <hi>D. Vſher,</hi> by
you recited, and ſo much applauded. For he ſuppoſeth, that a man agrees
with other Churches in beliefe, which ioyned with holy Obedience may bring him
to <pb n="135" facs="tcp:20773:72"/>euerlaſting ſaluation, and yet, that he may

damnable hereſies,</hi> who is ſuppoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue all <hi>Truths</hi>
neceſſary to ſaluation? Can there be any damnable hereſy, vnleſſe
it contradict ſome neceſſary truth, which cannot happen in one who is

foundation, conſiſting in the agreement of ſcarcely one point of fayth;
what a ſtrange Church would he make of men concurring in ſome one of few
Articles of beliefe, who yet for the reſt ſhould be holding conceyts
plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradictory: ſo patching vp a Religion of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who agree only in
the Article, that Chriſt is our Sauiour, but for the reſt, are like to the
parts of a Chimaera, hauing the head of a man, the necke of a horſe, the
ſhoulders of an Oxe, the foote of a Lion &amp;c. I wrong them not heerein.
For in good Philoſophy there is greater repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnancy betweene aſſent and
diſſent, affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and negation, <hi>eſt eſt, non non</hi>
(eſpecially when all theſe contrradictories pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vpon one and

then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the integrall parts, as head, necke, <pb n="136" facs="tcp:20773:73"/>&amp;c. of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, horſe, lion, &amp;c. And thus Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are
farre more bold to diſagree euen in matters of fayth, then Catholique Deuines

while thus they ſtand on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon <hi>fundamentall</hi> Articles, they do by
their owne confeſſion deſtroy the Church, which is the <hi>houſe of
God.</hi> For the <hi>foundation</hi> alone of a houſe, is not a houſe, nor

Can you ſay the Creed? Yes. And ſo can many damnable Heretikes. But why doe

properly conſtitute a Church, and are neceſſary (in ordinary courſe) to
be distinctly belieued by euery Chriſtian that will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. They are
thoſe grand, and capitall doctrines <pb n="139" facs="tcp:20773:74"/>which make vp our
Fayth in Christ; that is, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fayth which is alike precious in all,
being one &amp; the ſame in the higheſt Apostle, &amp; the meanest
belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which the Apoſtle elſe-where cals the first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the
oracles of God, and the forme of ſound words.</hi> But how ſhall I apply
theſe generall defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, or deſcriptions, or (to ſay the truth)
theſe only varied words, and phraſes (for I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the word,
<hi>fundamentall,</hi> as well as the words, <hi>principall, eſsentiall,

Creed, in ſuch ſort, as that I may be able preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely, exactly,
particularly to diſtinguiſh funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Articles, from points of

ſerues onely, either to make men deſpaire, or els to haue recourſe to
thoſe whom you call Papiſts, and who giue one certaine Rule, that all
points defined by Chriſts viſible Church belong to the foundation of Fayth,
in ſuch ſenſe, as that to deny any one cannot ſtand with ſaluation.
And ſeing your ſelfe acknowledges that theſe men do not erre in points
fundamentall, I cannot but hold it moſt ſafe for me to loyne with them, for
the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of my ſoule, and the auoyding of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, into which
this your doctrine muſt caſt all them who vnderſtand, and belieue it. For
the whole diſcourſe, and inferences which heer I haue made, are either your

cleerly dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from them.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But now let vs anſwere ſome few Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections of
<hi>D. Potters,</hi> againſt that which we haue ſaid before, to auoid our
argument, That the Scripture is not ſo much as mentioned in the Creed, he
ſayth: <hi>The Creed is an abstract of ſuch</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">pag. <hi>234.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>neceſſary Doctrines as are
deliuered in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> or collected out of it; and therfore needs not
expreſſe the authority of that which it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
               <p n="21">21. This anſwere makes for vs. For by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a
reaſon why it was needles that Scripture ſhould be expreſſed in the
Creed, you grant as much as we deſire, namely that the Apoſtles iudged it
<hi>needles</hi> to expreſse all neceſsary points of fayth in their Creed.
Neither doth the Creed ſuppoſe, or depend on Scripture, in ſuch ſort as
that we can by any probable conſequence, infer from the Articles of the
Creed, that there is any Canonicall Scripture at all; and much leſse that
ſuch Bookes in particular be Canonicall: Yea the Creed might haue been the
ſame although holy Scripture had neuer been written; and, which is more, the
Creed euen in priority of time, was before all the Scripture of the new
Teſtament, except the Goſpell of <hi>S. Mathew.</hi> And ſo according to
this reaſon of his the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſhould not mention Articles conteined in
the Creed And I note in a word, how little connexion <hi>D. Potters</hi>
arguments haue, while he <pb n="141" facs="tcp:20773:75"/>tels vs, that <hi>the

                  </note> 
                  <hi>is an
Abstract of ſuch neceſſary doctrines as are deliuered in Scripture, or
collected out of it, and therfore needs not expreſſe the authority of that
which it ſuppoſes;</hi> it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: The Articles of the Creed are
deliuered in Scripture: therfore the Creed ſuppoſeth Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. For two
diſtinct writings may well deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ſame truths, and yet one of them
not ſuppoſe the other, vnleſſe <hi>D. Potter</hi> be of opinion that
two Doctours cannot, <hi>at one time,</hi> ſpeake the ſame truth.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And notwithſtanding, that <hi>D. Potter</hi> hath
now told vs, it was <hi>needles</hi> that the Creed ſhould expreſſe
Scripture, whoſe <hi>Authority it ſuppoſes,</hi> he comes at length to
ſay, that the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Fathers in their Creed confeſsing that the holy
Ghost ſpake by the Prophets, doth therby ſufficiently auow the diuine
Authority of all Canonicall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi> But I would aske him, whether the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Creed be not alſo an Abſtract of Doctrines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in
Scripture, as he ſaid of the Apoſtles Creed, and thence did infer, that it
was needles to expreſſe Scripture, <hi>whoſe authority it
ſuppoſes?</hi> Beſides we do not only belieue in generall, that
Canonicall Scripture is of diuine authority, but we are alſo bound vnder
paine of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to belieue, that ſuch and ſuch particular Bookes, not
mentioned in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, are Canonicall. And laſtly <hi>D.
Potter</hi> in this Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were grants as much as we deſire, which is that all
points of fayth are not contained in the <pb n="142" facs="tcp:20773:76"/>Apoſtles Creed,
euen as it is <hi>explained</hi> by other Creeds. For theſe words <hi>(who
ſpake by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets)</hi> are no wayes contained in the Apoſtles Creed,
and therfore containe an <hi>Addition,</hi> not an <hi>Explanation</hi>
therof</p>
               <p n="23">23. But, <hi>how can it be neceſſary</hi> (ſayth

                  <hi>Apostles had,

diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Apoſtles beliefe, and that abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
ſome Articles of fayth, which we call the Apoſtles <hi>Creed;</hi> and
withall you begg the queſtion, by ſuppoſing that the Apoſtles belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
no more, then is contained in their Creed, which euery vnlearned perſon
knowes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieues: and I hope you will not deny but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were

               <p n="24">24. Your pretended proofe out of the Acts, that the

               <p n="25">25. Vpon the ſame affected ambiguity is grounded your

with that which we commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly call their Creed. Did not, I pray you, <hi>S.
Mathew,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> belieue their writings to be Canonicall
Scripture? and yet their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges are not mentioned in the Creed. It is
therfore more then cleere, that the Fayth of the Apoſtles is of a larger
extent, then the Apoſtles Creed.</p>
               <p n="26">26. To your demaund, why amongſt many things of equall

                  </note> 
                  <hi>ſo diſtinctly ſet downe
ſome, and be altogether ſilent of others?</hi> I anſwere: That you muſt
anſwere your owne demaund. For in the Creed there be diuers points in their
nature, not fundamentall, or neceſſary to be explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſtinctly
belieued, as aboue we ſhewed; why are theſe points which are not
fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall expreſſed, rather then other of the ſame 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20773:77"/>quality? Why our Sauiours deſcent to Hell, &amp; Buriall
expreſſed, and not his Circumciſion, his manifeſtation to the three
Kings, working of Miracles &amp;c? Why did they not expreſſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
Sacraments, and all fundamentall points of Fayth tending to practiſe, as well
as thoſe which reſt in beliefe? Their intention was, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to
deliuer ſuch Articles as were fitteſt for thoſe times, concerning the
Deity, Trinity, and Meſſias (as heretofore I haue declared) lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many
things to be taught by the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> which in the Creed we
all profeſſe to belieue. Neither doth it follow, as you infer, <hi>That as
well, nay better, they might haue giuen no Article, but that (of the Church)
and ſent vs to the Church for all the rest. For in ſetting downe others
beſides that, and not all, they make vs belieue we haue all, when</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">pag. <hi>223.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>we haue not all.</hi> For by this
kind of arguing, what may not be deduced? One might, quite contrary to your
inference, ſay: If the Apoſtles Creed containe all points neceſsary to
ſaluation, what need we any Church to teach vs? and conſequently what need
of the Article concerning the <hi>Church?</hi> What need we the Creeds of
<hi>Nice, Constantinople &amp;c.</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous are your Catechiſms,
wherin beſide the Articles of the Creed, you add diuers other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
Theſe would be poore conſequences, and ſo is yours. But ſhall I tell
you newes? For ſo you are pleaſed to eſteeme it. We grant your inference,
thus far: That our Sauiour Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred <pb n="145" facs="tcp:20773:77"/>vs to his
Church, by her to be taught, &amp; by her alone. For, ſhe was before the
Creed, and Scriptures; And ſhe to diſcharge this impoſed office of
inſtructing vs, hath deliuered vs the Creed, but not it alone, as if nothing
els were to be belieued. We haue beſides it, holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; we haue
vnwritten, diuine, Apoſtolicall Eccleſiaſticall Traditions. It were a
childiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: The Creed containes not all things which are
neceſſary to be belieued: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not profitable. Or; The
Church alone is ſufficient to teach vs by ſome conuenient meanes:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> ſhe muſt teach vs without all meanes, without Creeds,
without Councels, without Scripture &amp;c. If the Apoſtles had expreſsed
no Article, but that of the Catholique Church, ſhe muſt haue taught vs the
other Articles in particular, by Creeds, or other meanes, as in fact we haue
euen the Apoſtles Creed from the Tradition of the Church. If you will
<hi>belieue you haue all in the Creed, when you haue not all,</hi> it is not
the Apoſtles, or the Church, that makes you ſo belieue, but it is your owne
error, wherby you will needs belieue, that the Creed muſt containe
<hi>all.</hi> For neither the Apoſtles, nor the Church, nor the Creed it
ſelfe tell you any ſuch matter; and what neceſsity is there, that one
meanes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, muſt inuolue whatſoeuer is contained in all the
reſt? We are not to recite the Creed with anticipated perſwaſion, that it
muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine what we imagine it ought, for better <pb n="146" facs="tcp:20773:78"/>maintayning ſome opinions of our owne; but we ought to ſay, and
belieue that it containes what we find in it; of which one Article is to
belieue the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> ſurely to be taught by her, which
preſuppoſeth that we need other inſtruction beſide the Creed: and in
particuler we may learne of her, what points be contained in the Creed, what
otherwiſe; and ſo we ſhall not be deceiued, by belieuing we haue all in
the Creed, when we haue not all: and you may in the ſame manner ſay: <hi>As
well, nay better, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles might haue giuen vs no Articles</hi> at all, as
haue left out Articles tending to practiſe. For in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down one ſort

is ſufficient, to oppoſe the definition of Gods Church; That a

greatnes &amp; grieuouſnes, or (ſo to terme it) the <pb n="151" facs="tcp:20773:80"/>
                  <hi>Quantity</hi> thereof. For the Nature, or Quality will tell vs,
who may without iniury be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Schiſmatiques: and by the greatnes, or
quantity, ſuch as find themſelues guilty therof, will remaine acquainted
with the true ſtate of their ſoule, and whether they may conceiue any hope
of ſaluation or no. And becauſe Schiſme wil be found to be a diuiſion
from the Church, which could not happen, vnles there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a viſible
Church; we wil, Thirdly proue, or rather take it as a point to be granted by
all Chriſtians, that in all ages there hath been ſuch a Viſible
Congregation of Faythfull People. Fourthly, we will demonſtrate, that
<hi>Luther, Caluin,</hi> and the reſt, did ſeparate themſelues from the
Communion of that alwayes viſible Church of Chriſt, and therfore were
guilty of <hi>Schiſme.</hi> And fifthly we will make it euident, that the
viſible true Church of Chriſt, out of which <hi>Luther</hi> and his
followers departed, was no other but the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> &amp;
conſequently that both they, and all others who perſiſt in the ſame

<hi>Nature,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Point.</note> or <hi>Quality</hi> of
Schiſme: as the naturall perfection of man conſiſts in his being the
<hi>image</hi> of God his Creator, by the powers of his ſoule; ſo his
ſupernaturall perfection is placed in <hi>ſimilitude</hi> with God, as his
laſt End and Felicity;<note place="margin">The nature of Schiſme.</note> and
by hauing the ſaid ſpirituall faculties, his <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> 
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:20773:81"/>and <hi>Will</hi> linked to him. His Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is
vnited to God by <hi>Fayth;</hi> his Will, by <hi>Charity.</hi> The former
relies vpon his infallible <hi>Truth:</hi> The latter carrieth vs to his
infinite <hi>Goodnes. Fayth</hi> hath a deadly oppoſite, <hi>Hereſy.</hi>
Contrary to the Vnion, or Vnity of <hi>Charity,</hi> is Separation and
<hi>Diuiſion.</hi> Charity is twofold. As it reſpects <hi>God,</hi> his
Oppoſite Vice is <hi>Hatred</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>God:</hi> as it vniteth vs to
our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> his contrary is <hi>Separation</hi> or diuiſion of
affections, and will from our <hi>Neighbour.</hi> Our Neighbour may be
conſidered, either as one priuate perſon hath a ſingle relation to
another, or as all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to make one Company or Congregation, which we call
the Church; and this is the moſt principall reference and Vnion of one man
with another: becauſe the chiefeſt Vnity is that of the <hi>Whole,</hi> to
which the particular Vnity of <hi>Parts</hi> is ſubordinate. This Vnity, or
Oneneſſe (if ſo I may call it) is effected by Charity vniting all the
members of the Church in one <hi>Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Body;</hi> contrrary to which, is
<hi>Schiſme,</hi> from the Greeke word ſignifying <hi>Sciſsure,</hi> or
<hi>Diuiſion.</hi> Wherfore vpon the whole matter, we find that
<hi>Schiſme,</hi> as the Angelicall Doctor <hi>S. Thomas</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it,
is; <hi>A voluntary ſeparation</hi>

he deduceth, that <hi>Schiſme</hi> is a ſpeciall and particular vice,
diſtinct from <hi>Hereſy,</hi> becauſe they are oppoſite to two
different Vertues: Hereſy, to Fayth: Schiſme, to <pb n="153" facs="tcp:20773:81"/>Charity. To which purpoſe he fitly alleadgeth <hi>S. Hierome</hi>

corrupt the Fayth by belieuing of God falſe things: but Schiſmatiques by

we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue. Therefore the Heretique belongs not to the Church, becauſe ſhe

Schiſmatiques be distinguiſhed from He retiques: and this difference is

want Charity: ſo euery Heretique is a Schiſmatique, but not conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely
euery Schiſmatique is an Heretique; thogh becauſe want of Charity
diſpoſes and makes way to the deſtruction of fayth (according to thoſe
wordes of the Apoſtle, <hi>Which</hi> (a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) <hi>ſome
casting off, haue ſuffered ſhipwrack in their fayth</hi>) Schiſme
ſpeedily degenerates to <pb n="154" facs="tcp:20773:82"/>Hereſy, as <hi>S. Hierome</hi>
after the rehearſed words teacheth, ſaying: <hi>Though Schiſme in the
beginning may in ſome ſort be vnderſtood different from Hereſy; yet
there is no Schiſme which doth not faigne ſome hereſy to it ſelfe, that
ſo it may ſeeme to haue depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Church vpon good reaſon.</hi>
Neuertheles when Schiſme proceeds originally from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, Hereſy as
being in that caſe the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant quality in theſe two peccant humours,
gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the denomination of an <hi>Heretique;</hi> as on the other ſide we
are wont, eſpecially in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or for a while, to call
<hi>Schiſmatiques,</hi> thoſe men who firſt began with only
<hi>Schiſme,</hi> though in proceſſe of time they fell into ſome
<hi>Hereſy,</hi> and by that meanes are indeed both Schiſmatiques and
Heretiques.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The reaſon why both Hereſy and Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me are
repugnant to the being of a good <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> is: Becauſe the
<hi>Catholique,</hi> or Vniuerſall Church ſignifies <hi>One</hi>
Congregation, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Faithfull people, and therfore implies not only
<hi>Faith,</hi> to make them <hi>Faithfull</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, but alſo
<hi>Communion,</hi> or <hi>Common Vnion,</hi> to make them <hi>One</hi> in
Charity, which excludes Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and <hi>Diuiſion:</hi> and therfore in
the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed, <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ioyned to
the <hi>Catholique Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. From this definition of Schiſme may be inferred, that
the guilt therof is contracted, not only by diuiſion from the Vniuerſall
Church; but alſo, by a Separation from a particular <pb n="155" facs="tcp:20773:82"/>Church or Dioceſſe which agrees with the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall. In this
manner <hi>Meletius</hi> was a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique, but not an Heretique, becauſe
as we read in <hi>S. Epiphanus,</hi>
                  <note n="(h)" place="margin">Haereſ.
<hi>68.</hi>
                  </note> he was <hi>of the right Faith: for his fayth was not
altered at any time from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholique Church &amp;c. He made a Sect,
but depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not from Fayth.</hi> Yet becauſe he made to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a
particular Congregation againſt <hi>S. Peter</hi> Archbiſhop of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> his lawfull Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and by that meanes brought in a
diuiſion in that particular Church, we was a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique. And it is wel
worth the noting, that the <hi>Meletians</hi> building new Churches put this
title vpon them, <hi>The Church of Martyrs:</hi> and vpon the ancient Churches
of thoſe who ſucceeded <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> was inſcribed, <hi>The Catholique
Church.</hi> For ſo it is. A new Sect muſt haue a new name which though it
be neuer ſo gay and ſpecious, as <hi>the Church of Martyrs: the Reformed
Church &amp;c.</hi> yet the Nouelty ſheweth that it is not the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,
nor a true Church. And that Schiſme may be committed by diuiſion from a
particular Church, we read in <hi>Optatus Mileuitanus</hi>
                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> cont. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> theſe remarkable words,
(which do well declare who be Schiſmatiques) brought by him to proue that not
<hi>Caecilianus</hi> but <hi>Parmenianus</hi> was a Schiſmatique: For
<hi>Caecilianus went not out from Maiorinus thy Grand-Father</hi> (he meanes
his next predeceſſour but one, in the Biſhopricke,) <hi>but Maiorinus
from Caecilianus: neither did Caecilianus depart from the Chaire of Peter, or
of Cyprian</hi> (who <pb n="156" facs="tcp:20773:83"/>was but a particular Biſhop,)
<hi>but Maiorinus, in whoſe Chaire thou ſittest which had no beginning
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Maiorinus himſelfe. Seing it is manifestly knowne, that theſe
things were ſo done, it euidently appeareth, that you are heires both of
traditors</hi> (that is, of thoſe who deliuered vp the holy Bible to be
burned) <hi>and of Schiſmatiques.</hi> And it ſeemeth that this kind of
Schiſme muſt principally be admitted by Proteſtants, who acknowledge no
one viſible Head of the whole Church, but hold that euery particular
Dioceſſe, Church, or Countrey is gouerned by it ſelfe independantly of
any one Perſon, or Generall Councell, to which all Chriſtians haue
obligation to ſubmit their iudgments, and wills.</p>

Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</note> and the reſt did not depart from the externall

of Schiſme. And that they are properly Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques cleerely followeth
from the grounds which we haue layed, concerning the nature of 
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20773:88"/>Schiſme, which conſiſts in leauing the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Cummunion of the viſible Church of Chriſt our Lord: and it is cleere by
euidence of fact, that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers forſooke the
Communion of that Ancient Church. For they did not ſo much as pretend to
ioyne with any Congregation which had a being before their time; for they would
needs conceiue that no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Company was free from errours in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and corruption in practiſe: And therfore they oppoſed the doctrine; they
withdrew their obedience from the Prelates; they left partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in

vnleſſe they would participate with errors, corruptions, &amp;

according to <hi>D. Potter,</hi> the ſelfe ſame Church, which is the
Vniuerſall Church, remayning the vniuerſall true Church of Chriſt, may
fall into errors and corruptions: from whence it cleerely followeth that it is
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to leaue the <hi>Externall communion</hi> of the Church ſo
corrupted, and retaine <hi>externall</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Catholique
Church; ſince the Church Catholique, and the Church ſo corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted is the
ſelfe ſame one Church, or company of men. And the contrary imagination
talkes in a dreame, as if the errors and infections of the Catholique Church
were not inherent in her, but were ſeparate from her, like to
<hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> without any <hi>Subiect,</hi> or rather indeed, as if they
were not <hi>Accidents,</hi> but <hi>Hypostaſes,</hi> or <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
ſubſiſting by themſelues. For men cannot be ſaid to liue, in, or out
of the Communion of any dead creature, but with Perſons, endued with life and
reaſon; and much leſſe can men be ſaid to liue in the Communion of
Accidents, as errors and corruptions are, and therfore it is an abſurd thing
to affirme, that Proteſtants diuided <pb n="173" facs="tcp:20773:91"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from
the corruptions of the Church, but not from the Church herſelfe, ſeing the
corruptions of the Church were inherent in the Church. All this is made more
cleere, if we conſider, that when <hi>Luther</hi> appeared, there were not
two diſtinct viſible true Catholique Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, holding contrary Doctrines,
and diuided in externall Communion; one of the which two Churches did
<hi>triumph ouer all error,</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in doctrine and practiſe;
but the other was ſtained with both. For to faigne this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of two
Churches cannot ſtand with record of hiſtories, which are ſilent of any
ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is againſt <hi>D. Potters</hi> owne grounds, that the
Church may erre in points not fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, which were not true, if you will
imagine a certaine viſible Catholique Church free from error euen in points
not fundamentall. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth the words in which he ſaid, the Church
<hi>may not hope to triumph ouer all error, till ſhe be in heauen.</hi> It
euacuateth the brag of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, that <hi>Luther</hi> reformed the whole
Church: and laſtly it maketh <hi>Luther</hi> a Schiſmatique, for leauing
the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of all viſible Churches, ſeeing (vpon this ſuppoſition)
there was a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of Chriſt free from al corruption, which
therefore could not be forſaken without iuſt imputation of
<hi>Schiſme.</hi> We muſt therefore truly affirme, that ſince there was
but one viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of Chriſt, which was truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and yet was
(according to Proteſtants) <pb n="174" facs="tcp:20773:92"/>ſtained with corruption;
when <hi>Luther</hi> left the external Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of that corrupted Church, he
could not remaine in the Communion of the Catholique Church, no more then it is
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to keep company with <hi>Christopher Potter,</hi> and not keepe
company with the Prouoſt of Queenes Colledge in Oxford, if <hi>D. Potter</hi>
and the Prouoſt be one, and the ſelfe ſame man: For ſo one ſhould be,
and not be with him at the ſame time. This very argument drawne from the
Vnity of God's Church, <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> v rgeth to conuince, that
<hi>Nouatianus</hi> was cut off from the Church in theſe words: <hi>The
Church</hi> is<note n="(m)" place="margin">Epist. <hi>16.</hi> ad Mag.</note>
                  <hi>One, which being One cannot be both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. If ſhe be with
Nouatianus, ſhe was not with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius. But if she were with cornelius, who
ſucceeded Fabianus, by lawfull ordination, Nouatianus is not in the
Church.</hi> I purpoſely heere ſpeak only of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion</hi>
with the Catholique Church. For in this point there is great difference
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>internall acts</hi> of our Vnderſtanding, and will; and of
<hi>externall deeds.</hi> Our Vnderſtanding and Will are faculties (as
Philoſophers ſpeake) abſtractiue, and able to diſtinguiſh, and as it
were, to part things, though in themſelues they be really conioyned. But
reall externall deeds do take things in groſſe as they find them, not
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating things which in reality are ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Thus, one may
conſider and loue a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he is a man, frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, benefactor, or the
like; and at the ſame time not conſider him, nor loue <pb n="175" facs="tcp:20773:92"/>him as he is a ſinner; becauſe theſe are acts of our
Vnderſtanding and Will, which may reſpect their obiects vnder ſome one
formality, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, without reference to other things contained in
the ſelfe ſame obiects. But if one ſhould ſtrike, or kill a ſinnefull
man, he will not be excuſed, by alledging, that he killed him, not as a man,
but as a ſinner; becauſe the ſelfe ſame perſon being a man, and the
ſinner, the <hi>externall</hi> act of murder fell iointly vpon the man, &amp;
the ſinner. And for the ſame reaſon one cannot auoide the company of a
ſinner, and at the ſame time be really preſent with that man who is a
ſinner. And this is our caſe: and in this our Aduerſaries are
egregiouſly, and many of them affectedly, miſtaken. For one may in ſome
points belieue as the Church belieueth, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree from her in other. One
may loue the truth which ſhe holds, and deteſt her (pretended)
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. But it is impoſſible that a man ſhould really ſeparate
himſelfe from her externall Communion, as ſhe is corrupted, and be really
within the ſame externall Communion as ſhe is ſound; becauſe ſhe is
the ſelfe ſame Church which is ſuppoſed to be ſound in ſome things,
and to erre in others. Now, our queſtion for the preſent doth concerne only
this point of <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Communion:</hi> becauſe <hi>Schiſme,</hi> as
it is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Hereſy</hi> is committed when one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides himſelfe from the
<hi>Externall Communion</hi> of that Church with which he agrees in
<hi>Fayth;</hi> 
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:20773:93"/>Wheras Hereſy doth neceſſarily imply
a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in matter of <hi>Fayth,</hi> and beliefe: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay,
that they left not the viſible Church, but her errors, can only excuſe them
from <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy</hi> (which ſhall be tried in the next Chapter) but not
from <hi>Schiſme,</hi> as long as they are really druided from the
<hi>Externall Communion</hi> of the ſelfe ſame viſible Church; which,
notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe errors wherin they do in iudgment diſſent from
her, doth ſtill remaine the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church of Chriſt; and therfore
while they forſake the corrupted Church, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Catholique
Church. Thus then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth cleere, that their chiefeſt Anſwere

               <p n="19">19. Now then, that corruptions in doctrine (I ſtill
ſpeake vpon the vntrue ſuppoſition of our Aduerſaries) could not
affoard any ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cauſe, or colourable neceſſity to depart from
that viſible Church, which was extant when <hi>Luther</hi> roſe, I
demonſtrate out of <hi>D. Potters</hi> own confeſſion; that the
Catholique Church nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath, nor can erre in points <hi>fundamentall,</hi>
as we ſhewed out of his owne expreſſe words, which he alſo of ſet

vpon earth: becauſe any one <hi>fundamentall</hi> error ouerthrowes the
<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of a true Church. Now (as Schoolemen ſpeake) it is,
<hi>implicatio in terminis</hi> (a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo plaine, that one word
deſtroyeth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if one ſhould ſay, a liuing dead man) to
affirme that the Church doth not erre in points neceſſary to ſaluation,
or damnably; &amp; yet that it is damnable to remaine in her Communion
becauſe ſhe teacheth errors which are confeſſed not to be damnable. For
if the error be not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, nor againſt any fundamentall Article of Fayth,
the beliefe therof cannot be damnable. But <hi>D. Potter</hi> teacheth, that

<hi>hath not</hi> erred againſt any fundamentall Article of 
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20773:95"/>Fayth Therfore, it cannot be damnable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in her

               <p n="20">20. From the ſelfe ſame ground of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the Church in all fundamentall points, I argue after this manner. The
viſible Church cannot be forſaken, without damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vpon pretence that
it is damnable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in her Communion, by reaſon of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in
doctrine; as long as, for the truth of her Fayth and beliefe, ſhe performeth
the duty which ſhe oweth to God, and her Neighbour: As long as ſhe
performeth what our Sauiour exacts at her hands: as long as ſhe doth, as much
as lies in her power to do. But (euen according to <hi>D Potters</hi>
Aſſertions) the Church performeth all theſe things, as long as ſhe
erreth not in <pb n="182" facs="tcp:20773:96"/>points fundamentall, although ſhe were
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to erre in other points not fundamentall. Therefore, the
Communion of the Viſible Church cannot be forſaken without damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vpon
pretence that it is damnable to remaine in her Communion, by reaſon of
corruption in doctrine. The <hi>Maior,</hi> or firſt Propoſition of it

the truth of her doctrines and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe) owes no more duty to God and her
Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; neither doth our Sauiour exact more at her hands, nor is it in her

himſelfe. To depart from a particular Church, &amp; namely from the Church of
Rome, in ſome doctrines and practiſes, there might be iust and
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary cauſe, though the Church of Rome wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neceſſary
to ſaluation.</hi> Marke his doctrine, that there <hi>can be no iust cauſe
to depart from the Church of Chriſt:</hi> and yet he teacheth that the Church
of Chriſt may erre in points not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall; Therfore (ſay I) we cannot
forſake the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for points not fundamental, for then we
might alſo forſake the Church of Chriſt, which your ſelfe deny: and I
pray you conſider whether you do not plainely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict your ſelfe, while
in the words aboue reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you ſay there can be no <hi>iust cauſe to
forſake</hi> the Catholique Church; and yet that there may be neceſſary
cauſe to depart from the Church of Rome, ſince you grant that the Church of
Chriſt may erre in points not fundamentall; &amp; that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church hath erred only in ſuch points; as by and by we ſhall ſee more in
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. And thus much be ſaid to diſproue their chiefeſt Anſwere,
that they left not the <hi>Church,</hi> but her <hi>Corruptions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26. Another euaſion <hi>D. Potter</hi> bringeth, to
auoid the imputation of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> and it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſtill
acknowledge the Church of Rome to be a <hi>Member of the body of Christ,</hi>
and <pb n="189" facs="tcp:20773:99"/>not <hi>cut off from the hope of ſaluation. And

                  <hi>the imputation of Schiſme, whoſe property it is, to
cut of from the Body of Christ, and the hope of ſaluation, the Church from
which it ſeparates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27. This is an Anſwere which perhaps you may get ſome
one to approue, if firſt you can put him out of his wits. For what prodigious
doctrines are theſe? Thoſe Proteſtants who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that the Church erred
in points neceſſary to ſaluation, and for that cauſe left her, cannot
be excuſed from damnable <hi>Schiſme:</hi> But others who belieued that
ſhe had no damnable errors, did very well, yea were obliged to forſake her:
and (which is more miraculous, or rather mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous) they did well to
forſake her formally and preciſely, <hi>becauſe</hi> they
<hi>iudged,</hi> that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained all meanes neceſſary to ſaluation.
I ſay, <hi>becauſe</hi> they ſo <hi>iudged.</hi> For the very reaſon
for which he acquitteth himſelfe, and condemneth thoſe others as
Schiſmatiques, is becauſe he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that the Church which both of them
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke, is not cut of from the <hi>Body of Chriſt, and the hope of
ſaluation;</hi> whereas thoſe other Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots deny her to be a member of
Chriſts Body, or capable of ſaluation, wherin alone they diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from
<hi>D. Potter:</hi> for in the effect of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they agree, only they do
it vpon a different motiue or reaſon. Were it not a ſtrang excuſe if a
man would thinke to cloake his rebellion, by alledging that he held the
perſon againſt whom <pb n="190" facs="tcp:20773:100"/>he rebelled to be his lawfull
Soueraygne? And <hi>D. Potter</hi> thinkes himſelfe free from Schiſme,
becauſe he forſooke the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but yet ſo, as that
ſtil he held her to be the true Church, and to haue all neceſſary meanes
to Saluation. But I will no further vrge this moſt ſolemne foppery, and doe
much more willingly put all Catholiques in mind, what an vnſpeakeable comfort
it is, that out Aduerſaries are forced to confeſſe, that they cannot
cleere themſelues from <hi>Schiſme,</hi> otherwiſe then by acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
that they do not, nor cannot <hi>cut off from the Hope of ſaluation</hi> our
Church. Which is as much as if they ſhould in plaine termes ſay: They
muſt be damned, vnleſſe we may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Moreouer this euaſion doth
indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne your zealous Brethren of <hi>Hereſy,</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the
Churches perpetuity, but doth not cleere your ſelfe from <hi>Schiſme,</hi>
which conſiſts in being diuided from that true Church, with which a man
agreeth in all points of fayth, as you muſt profeſſe your ſelfe to
agree with the Church of Rome in all fundamentall Articles. For other wiſe
you ſhould cut her off from the hope of ſaluation, and ſo condemne your
ſelfe of <hi>Schiſme.</hi> And laſtly euen according to the your owne
definition of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> you cannot cleere your ſelfe from that
crime, vnleſſe you be content to acknowledge a manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in

But the truth is, there is no conſtancy in your Aſſertions, by reaſon

that the thinge, vpon which their thoughts firſt pitched, was not any

You cannot be ignorant but that many chiefe learned Proteſtants are forced to

infected with ſome diſeaſe, would deny themſelues to be
<hi>Schiſmatiques,</hi> or any way blame-worthy, but could not deny, but that
they left the ſayd Communities: So <hi>Luther</hi> and the reſt cannot ſo
much as pretend, not to haue left the viſible Church, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to
them was infected with many diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but can only pretend that they did
not ſinne in leauing her. And you ſpeake very ſtrangely 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20773:104"/>when you ſay: <hi>In a Society of men vniuerſally
infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with ſome diſeaſe, they that ſhould free the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from
the Common diſeaſe, could not be therefore ſaid to ſeparate from the
Society.</hi> For if they doe not ſeparate themſelues from the Society of
the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſons; how do they free themſelues &amp; depart from the
common diſeaſe? Do they at the ſame tyme remaine <hi>in the company,</hi>
and yet depart <hi>from</hi> thoſe infected creatures? We muſt then ſay,
that they <hi>ſeparate</hi> themſelues from the perſons, though it be by
occaſion of the diſeaſe: Or if you ſay, they free their owne perſons
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the common diſeaſe, yet ſo, that they remaine ſtill in the Company
infected, ſubiect to the Superiours and Gouernours thereof, eating &amp;
drinking &amp; keeping publique Aſſemblies with them; you cannot but know,
that <hi>Luther</hi> and your Reformers the firſt pretended free perſons
from the ſuppoſed common infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, did not ſo: for
they endeauoured to force the Society whereof they were parts, to be healed and
reformed as they were: and if it refuſed, they did, when they had forces,
driue them away, euen their Superiours both ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and temporall, as is
notorious. Or if they had not power to expell that ſuppoſed infected
Community, or Church of that place, they departed from them corporally, whome
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally they had forſaken before. So that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but
<hi>Luther</hi> forſooke the external Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and Company of the
Catholique <pb n="200" facs="tcp:20773:105"/>Church, for which as your ſelfe<note n="(z)" place="margin">Pag. <hi>75.</hi>
                  </note> confeſſe, <hi>There neyther was nor
can be any iust cauſe, no more then to depart from Christ himſelfe.</hi> We
do ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inferre, that <hi>Luther</hi> and the reſt who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke that
viſible Church which they found vpon earth, were truly, and <hi>properly
Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="35">35. Moreouer, it is euident that there was a diuiſion
betweene <hi>Luther</hi> and that Church which was Viſible when he aroſe:
but that Church cannot be ſayed to haue deuided her ſelfe from him, before
whoſe tyme ſhe was, &amp; in compariſon of whome ſhe was a
<hi>Whole,</hi> and he but a <hi>part:</hi> therefore we muſt ſay, that he
deuided himſelfe &amp; went out of her; which is to be a
<hi>Schiſmatique,</hi> or <hi>Heretique,</hi> or both. By this argument,
<hi>Optatus Meliuitanus</hi> proueth, that not <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> but
<hi>Parmenianus</hi> was a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique, ſaying: <hi>For, Caecilianus

                  <hi>not
out of Maiorinus thy Grandfather, but Maiorinus from Caecilianus: neyther did
Caecilianus depart from the Chayre of Peter, or Cyprian, but Maiorinus, in
whoſe Chaire thou ſittest, which had no beginning before Maiorinus. Since
it manifestly appeareth that theſe things were acted in this manuer, it is
cleere that you are heyres both of the deliuerers vp</hi> (of the holy Bible to
be burned) <hi>and alſo of Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.</hi> The whole argument of this
holy Father makes directly both againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> and all thoſe who
continue the diuiſion which he begun; and proues: That, <hi>going out,</hi>
conuinceth thoſe <pb n="201" facs="tcp:20773:105"/>who go out to be Sciſmatiques; but
not thoſe from whome they depart: That to forſake the Chaire of Peter is
<hi>Schiſme;</hi> yea, that it is <hi>Schiſme</hi> to erect a Chaire which
had no origen, or as it were predeceſſour, before it ſelfe: That to
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in a diuiſion begun by others, is to be <hi>Heires of
Schiſmatiques:</hi> and laſtly; that to depart from the Communion of a
particuler Church (as that of <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> was) is ſufficient to make
a man incurre the guilt of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that
although Proteſtants, who deny the Pope to be ſupreme Head of the Church,
do thinke by that <hi>Hereſy</hi> to cleere <hi>Luther</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
in diſobeying the Pope: Yet that will not ſerue to free him from
<hi>Schiſme,</hi> as it importeth a diuiſion from the obedience, or
Communion of the particular Biſhop, Dioceſſe, Church, &amp; Countrey,
where he liued.</p>
               <p n="36">36. But it is not the hereſy of Proteſtants, or any
other Sectaries, that can depriue <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and his Succeſſours,
of the authority which Chriſt our Lord conferred vpon them ouer his whole
militant Church: which is a point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by learned Proteſtants to be
of great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and for which the iudgement of diuers moſt ancient holy

plainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <hi>Luther,</hi> whether he will vnderſtand them as
ſpoken of the <hi>Vniuerſall,</hi> or of euery <hi>particular</hi> Church.
For he withdrew himſelfe both from the obedience of the Pope, and of all
particular Biſhops, and Churches. And no leſſe cleere is the ſayd

                  <hi>but that thou
knowest, that in the Citty of Rome, there was first an Epiſcopall Chaire
placed for Peter, wherin Peter the head of all the Apost es ſat, wherof
alſo he was called Cephas; in which one Chaire, Vnity was to be kept by all,
least the other Apoſtles might attribute to themſelues, ech one his
particular Chaire; and that he ſhould be a Schiſmatique and ſinner, who
againſt that one ſingle Chaire ſhould erect another.</hi> Many other
Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Fathers might be alledged to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which I omit, my
intention being not to handle particular controuerſies.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Now, the arguments which hitherto I haue brought,
proue that <hi>Luther,</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers were Schiſmatiques, without
exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (for as much as belonges to this point) whether or no the Church can
erre in any one thing great or ſmall, becauſe it is vniuerſally true,
that there can be no iuſt cauſe to forſake the Communion of the Viſible
Church of Chriſt, according to <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> ſaying: <hi>It is not
poſsible</hi>
                  <note n="(e)" place="margin">Ep. <hi>48.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>that any
may haue iust cauſe to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their Communion, from the Communion of the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20773:106"/>whole world, and call themſelues the Church of
Chriſt, as if they had ſeparated themſelues from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all
Nations vpon iust cauſe.</hi> But ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Church cannot erre in
any one point of doctrine, nor can approue any corruption in manners; they
cannot with any colour auoid the iuſt imputation of <hi>eminent</hi>
Schiſme, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the verdict of the ſame holy Father in theſe
words: <hi>The most manifest</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="38">38. Laſtly, I proue that Proteſtants cannot auoid the
note of Schiſme, at leaſt by reaſon of their mutuall ſeparation from
one another For moſt certaine it is that there is very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for
the outward face of a Church, and profeſſion of a different fayth, between
the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> the rigid <hi>Caluinists,</hi> and the
<hi>Protestants</hi> of England So that if <hi>Luther</hi> were in the right,
thoſe other Proteſtants who inuented Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes far different from his, and
diuided themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues from him, muſt be reputed <hi>Schiſmatiques:</hi>
&amp; the like argument may proportionably be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to their further
diuiſions, and ſubdiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Which reaſon I yet vrge more ſtrongly
out of <hi>D Potter,</hi>
                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">pag. <hi>20.</hi>
                  </note>
who affirmes, that to him &amp; to ſuch as are conuicted in conſcience of
the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, a reconciliation is
<hi>impoſsible,</hi> and <hi>damnable:</hi> And yet he teacheth, that their
difference from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is not in fundamentall points. Now,
ſince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <pb n="204" facs="tcp:20773:107"/>Proteſtants there is ſuch diuerſity
of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, that one denieth what the other affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, they muſt be
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uicted in conſcience that one part is in error (at leaſt not
fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall.) and, if <hi>D. Potter</hi> will ſpeake conſequently, that a
reconciliation between them is <hi>impoſsible:</hi> and what greater
diuiſion, or <hi>Schiſme</hi> can there be, then when one part muſt iudge
a reconciliation with the other to be <hi>impoſsible,</hi> and
<hi>damnable?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="39">39. Out of all which premiſſes, this
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> followes: That, <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; his followers were
<hi>Schiſmatiques;</hi> from the vniuerſall viſible Church; from the Pope
Chriſts Vicar on earth, and Succeſſour to <hi>S. Peter;</hi> from the
particular Dioceſſe in which they receiued Baptiſme; from the Countrey or
Nation to which they belonged; from the Biſhop vnder whom they liued; many of
them from the Religious Order in which they were Profeſſed; from one
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And laſtly from a mans ſelfe (as much as is poſſible)
becauſe the ſelfe ſame Proteſtant to day <hi>is conuicted in
conſcience,</hi> that his yeſterday's Opinion was an error (as <hi>D.
Potter</hi> knowes a man in the world who from a Puritan was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a

<hi>D. Potters</hi> grounds, is both <hi>impoſsible,</hi> and
<hi>damnable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="40">40. It ſeemes <hi>D. Potters</hi> laſt refuge to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelfe and his Brethren from Schiſme, is becauſe they
proceeded according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, dictating an obligation vnder

               </p>
               <p n="41">41. I anſwere: It is very ſtrang, that you iudge vs

your ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch the ſame of all learned Catholiques, whom ignorance
cannot excuſe. If this your pretence of conſcience may ſerue, what
Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique in the Church, what popular ſeditious braine in a kingdome,
may not alledge the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctamen of conſcience to free themſelues from
<hi>Schiſme,</hi> or <hi>Sedition?</hi> No man wiſhes them to do any thing
againſt their conſcience, but we ſay, that they may, and ought to
rectifie, and depoſe ſuch a conſcience, which is <hi>eaſy</hi> for them
to do, euen according to your owne affirmation; that we Catholiques want no

neceſſary to ſaluation, and yet I cannot hope to beſaued in that

aſſertions. After due examination I iudge the Roman er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors 
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20773:108"/>not to be in themſelues fundamentall, or damnable; and
yet I iudge that according to true reaſon, it is damnable to hold them? I
ſay <hi>according to true reaſon.</hi> For if you grant your conſcience
to be <hi>erroneous,</hi> in iudging that you cannot be ſaued in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her errors; there is no other remedy,
but that you muſt rectify your erring conſcience, by your other Iudgment,
that her errours are not fundamentall, nor damnable. And this is no more
Charity, then you daily affoard to ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proteſtants as you terme
Brethren, whom you cannot deny to be in ſome errors, (vnles you will hold,
That of contradictory propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both may be true) &amp; yet you do not
iudge it damnable to liue in their Communion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you hold their errours

wherof I will do a deed of Charity by putting you in mind, into what labyrinths
you are brought, by teaching that the Church may erre in ſome points of

leaue her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, though he haue euidence of Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt 
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:20773:110"/>her. Will you haue ſuch a man diſſemble againſt
his conſcience, or externally deny a truth knowne to be contained in holy
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture? How much more coherently do Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques proceed, who belieue the
vniuerſall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church, and from thence are aſſured that
there can be no euidence of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or reaſon againſt her definitions,
nor any iuſt cauſe to forſake her Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion? M. Hooker eſteemed by many

                  <hi>good Catholique Biſhops were of the ſame opinion
with the Donatists, that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Heretiques was ineffectuall; and
with the Nouatians, that the Church ought not to abſolue ſome grieuous
ſinners. Theſe errors therfore (if they had gone no further) were not in
themſelues Hereticall, eſpecially in the proper, and most heauy, or bitter 
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:20773:111"/>ſenſe of that word; neither was it in the Churches
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention (or in her power) to make them ſuch by her declaration. Her
intention was to ſilence all diſputes, and to ſettle peace and Vnity in
her gouernment: to which all wiſe and peaceable men ſubmitted,
whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their opinion was. And thoſe factious people, for their
vnreaſonable and vncharitable oppoſition, were very iustly branded for
Schiſmatiques. For vs, the</hi> Miſtaker <hi>will neuer proue that we
oppoſe any declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Catholique Church &amp;c. and therfore he doth
vniustly charge vs either with Schiſme, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy.</hi> Theſe words
manifeſtly condemne your Reformers who oppoſed the viſible Church in many
of her declarations, Doctrines, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds impoſed vpon them, for
ſilencing all diſputes, <hi>and ſetling peace and Vnity in the
gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and therfore they ſtill remayning obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely

it is to be obſerued that you grant the <hi>Donatists</hi> to haue been
<hi>very iustly bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for Schiſmatiques,</hi> although their oppoſition
againſt the Church did concerne (as you hold) a point not fundamentall to the
Fayth, and which according to <hi>S. Augustine</hi> cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued out of
Scripture alone; and therfore either doth euidently conuince that the Church is
v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſally infallible, euen in points not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, or elſe that it
is <hi>Schiſme</hi> to oppoſe her declarations in thoſe very things
wherin ſhe may erre; and conſequently that <hi>Luther,</hi> and his

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:20773:111"/>Church for points not fundamentall, though it were
(vntruly) ſuppoſed that ſhe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſuch points. But by the way, how
come you on the ſuddaine to hold the determination of a Generall Councell (of
<hi>Nice</hi>) to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Catholique Church, ſeeing you
teach, That Generall Councels may erre euen fundamentally? And do you now

ſome other motiues which induced him to oppoſe the Church. And if yet you

as you ſaid all men ought to do? And that you may be ſure that he ſpoke
from his <pb n="215" facs="tcp:20773:112"/>heart, and if occaſion had been offered, would
haue been as good as his word; marke what he ſayth of the Eleuation of the

               <p n="44">44. Some are ſaid to flatter themſelues with another

after a certaine time of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring from their right home, fall from their

Character</hi> of Baptiſme, and liue vpon earth, they are obliged to
acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge ſubiection to God's Church. Human Lawes may come to nothing by
diſcontinuance of Time, but the Law of God, commaunding vs to conſerue
Vnity in his Church, doth ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. The continued diſobedience of
Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cannot depriue Parents of their paternall right, nor can the
Grand-child be vndutifull to his Grand Father, becauſe his Father was
vnnaturall to his owne Parent. The longer God's Church is diſobeyed; the
profeſſion of her Doctrine denyed her Sacraments neglected; her Liturgy
condemned; her Vnity violated; the more grieuous the fault growes to be: as the
longer a man with-holds a due debt, or retaines <pb n="220" facs="tcp:20773:115"/>his
Neighbours goods, the greater iniuſtice he commits. Conſtancy in euill doth
not exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, but aggrauate the ſame, which by exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Time,
receiueth increaſe of ſtrength, &amp; addition of greater malice. If
theſe mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits were true, the Church might come to be wholy diuided by
wicked Schiſmes, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome ſpace of time, none could be

they diſagreed from Catholiques. For he well knowes that the example of
ſuch men is ſubiect to theſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt exceptions. They were not of all
Ages, nor in all Countries, but confined to certaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and were
interrupted in Time, againſt the notion and nature of the word
<hi>Catholique.</hi> They had no Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchy, nor
Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Paſtours. They dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered among

               <p n="50">50. The <hi>Waldenſes</hi> begun not before the yeare
1218. ſo far were they from Vniuerſality of all Ages. For their doctrine:
firſt, they denied all Iudgments which extended to the drawing of bloud, and
the Sabbaoth, for which cauſe they were called In-ſabbatiſts. Secondly,
they taught that Lay men, and women might conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the Sacrament, and
preach (no doubt but by this meanes to make their Maiſter, <hi>Waldo,</hi> a
meere lay man, capable of ſuch functions.) Thirdly, that Clergy men ought to
haue no poſſeſſions, or proprieties. Fourthly, that there ſhould be
no diuiſion of Pariſhes, nor Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <pb n="225" facs="tcp:20773:117"/>for a walled
Church they reputed as a barne. Fiftly, that men ought not to take an oath in
any caſe. Sixtly, that thoſe perſons ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mortally, who accompanied
without hope of iſſue. Seauenthly, they held all things done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the
girdle, by kiſſing, touching, words, compreſſion of the breaſts,
&amp;c. to be done in Charity, and not againſt Continency. Eightly, that
neither Prieſt, nor ciuill Magiſtrate, being guilty of mortall ſinne did
enioy their dignity, or were to be obeyed. Ninthly, they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Princes,
and Iudges. Tenthly, they affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſinging in the Church to be an helliſh
cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. Eleauenthly, they taught that men might diſſemble their Religion,
and ſo accordingly they went to Catholique Churches, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling their
Fayth, and made Offertories, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and communions after a

damnable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as diuers Proteſtant Writers relate. As firſt: If a
Biſhop or Prieſt be in deadly ſinne, he doth not indeed either giue
Orders, Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, or Baptize. Secondly, That Eccleſiaſticall
Miniſters ought not to haue any temporall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, nor propriety
in any thing, but ſhould beg; and yet he himſelfe brake into hereſy
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had been depriued by the Archbiſhop of Canterbury of a certaine
Benefice; as all Schiſmes, &amp; hereſies begin vpon paſſion, which
they ſeeke to couer with the cloake of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Thirdly he condemned
lawfull Oaths, like the Anabaptiſts. Fourthly, he taught that all things came
to paſſe by abſolute neceſſity. Fiftly, he defended human merits as
the wicked <hi>Pelagians</hi> did, namely, as proceeding from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forces,
without the neceſſary help of God's grace. Sixtly, that no man is a Ciuill
Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, while he is in mortall ſinne; and that the people may at their
pleaſure correc<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Princes, when they offend: by which doctrine he proues
himſelfe both an Heretique, and a Traytour.</p>
               <p n="53">53. As for <hi>Huſſe,</hi> his chiefeſt Doctrines
were: That Lay people muſt receiue in <hi>both kinds;</hi> and That Ciuill
Lords Prelates, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops looſe all right, and authority, while they are
in mortall ſinne For other things he wholy agreed with Catholiques againſt
Proteſtants; <pb n="228" facs="tcp:20773:119"/>and the <hi>Bohemians</hi> his followers
being demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in what points they diſagreed from the Church of

That <hi>Preaching of the word, was free for all men,</hi> and in all

               <p n="55">55. It being therefore granted that Chriſt had a

that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from her, and conſequently

By theſe arguments and inducements our Vnderſtanding is both ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20773:124"/>of manifeſt and incorrupt Tradition, I know that there
hath alwayes been a neuer interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Succeſſion of men from the
Apoſtles tyme, belieuing, profeſſing, and practiſing ſuch and ſuch
doctrines: By euident arguments of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, as Miracles, Sanctity, Vnity
&amp;c. and by all thoſe wayes whereby the Apoſtles, and our Bleſſeed
Sauiour himſelfe confirmed their doctrine, we are aſſured that what the
ſayd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer interrupted Church propoſeth, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to be accepted
&amp; aknowledged as a diuine truth: By euidence of Senſe, we ſee that the
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me Church propoſeth ſuch and ſuch doctrines as diuine truths, that
is, as reuealed and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by Almighty God. By this diuine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
we are infallibly aſſured of what we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue: and ſo the laſt period,
ground, motiue, and <hi>formall obiect</hi> of our Fayth, is the infallible
teſtimony of that ſupreme Verity, which ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can deceyue, nor be
deceiued.</p>
               <p n="7">7. By this orderly deduction our Faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be
endued with theſe qualities which we ſaid were requiſite thereto; namely
<hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Obſcurity,</hi> and <hi>Pruderce. Certaimy</hi> proceeds from
the <hi>infallible</hi> Teſtimony of God propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; conueied to our
vnderſtanding by ſuch a meane, as is infallible in it ſelfe, and to vs is
eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently knowne that it propoſeth this point or that, and which can
manifeſtly declare in what ſenſe it propoſeth them; which meanes we
haue proued to be only the viſible Church of Chriſt. <pb n="239" facs="tcp:20773:124"/>
                  <hi>Obſcurity</hi> from the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner in which God ſpeakes to
Mankind, which ordinarily is ſuch, that it doth not manifeſtly ſhew the
perſon who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, nor the truth of the thing ſpoken. <hi>Prudence</hi>
is not wanting, becauſe our fayth is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſo many arguments of
<hi>Credibility,</hi> that euery wel diſpoſed <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> may
&amp; ought to iudge, that the doctrines ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed deſerue to be
belieued, as proceeding from Authority.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And thus from what hath been ſaid, we may eaſily
gather the particular nature, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of <hi>Fayth.</hi> For, <hi>it is
a voluntary, or free, infallible obſcure aſsent to ſome truth, becauſe
it is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyed by God, &amp; is ſufficiently propounded to vs for
ſuch:</hi> which propoſal is ordinarily made by the viſible Church of
Chriſt. I ſay, <hi>Sufficiently propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Church;</hi> not that I
purpoſe to diſpute whether the propoſall of the Church enter into the
<hi>formall Obiect,</hi> or <hi>motiue</hi> of Fayth: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an error be
any hereſy, <hi>formally and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely,</hi> becauſe it is againſt the
propoſition of the Church, as if ſuch propoſall were the formall Obiect
of fayth, which <hi>D. Potter</hi> to no purpoſe at all, labours ſo very
hard to diſproue: But I only affirme, that when the Church propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds any
Truth, as reuealed by God, we are aſſured that it is ſuch indeed; &amp;
ſo it inſtantly growes, to be a fit Obiect for Chriſtian fayth, which
onclines and enables vs, to belieue whatſoeuer is duely preſented, as a
thing reuealed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. And in the ſame manner we are 
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:20773:125"/>ſure that whoſoeuer oppoſeth any doctrine
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Church, doth thereby contradict a truth, which is
teſtified by God: As when any lawfull Superiour, notifies his will, by the
meanes, and as it were propoſall of ſome faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meſſenger, the
ſubiect of ſuch a Superiour in performing, or neglecting what is deliuered
by the meſſenger, is ſaid to obey, or diſobey his owne lawfull
Superiour. And therfore becauſe the teſtimony of God is notified by the
Church, we may, and we do moſt truly ſay, that not to belieue what the
Church propoſeth, is to deny God's holy word or teſtimony, ſignified to
vs by the Church, according to that ſaying of <hi>S. Irenaeus. We need not
goe</hi>

receiue from the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. From this definition of fayth we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo know what
<hi>Hereſy</hi> is, by taking the contrary termes, as <hi>Hereſy</hi> is
contrary to <hi>Fayth,</hi> and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Hereſy is a voluntary error
against that which God hath reucaled, and the Church hath propoſed for
ſuch.</hi> Neither doth it import, whether the error concerne points in
themſelues great or ſmall, fundamentall or not fundamentall. For more being
required to an act of Vertue, then of Vice, if any truth though neuer ſo
ſmall may be belieued by <hi>Fayth</hi> aſſoone as we know it to be
teſtified by diuine rouelation; much more will it be a formall
<hi>Hereſy</hi> to deny any leaſt point ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded as a
thing witneſſed by God.</p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:20773:125"/>
               <p n="10">10. This diuine Fayth is diuided into <hi>Actuall,</hi>
and <hi>Habituall. Actuall</hi> fayth, or fayth actuated is when we are in act
of conſideration, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of ſome myſtery of Fayth; for example,
that our Sauiour Chriſt, is true God, and Man, &amp;c. <hi>Habituall</hi>
fayth, is that from which we are denominated <hi>Faithfull,</hi> or
<hi>Belieuers,</hi> as by <hi>actuall</hi> fayth they are ſtiled,
<hi>Belieuing.</hi> This <hi>Habit</hi> of fayth is a <hi>Quality,</hi>
enabling vs moſt firmely to belieue Obiects aboue human diſcourſe, and it
remaineth permanently in our Soule, euen when we are ſleeping, or not
thinking of any Myſtery of Fayth. This is the firſt among the three
<hi>Theologicall</hi> Vertues. For <hi>Charity</hi> vnites vs to God, as he is
infinitely <hi>Good in himſelfe; Hope</hi> ties vs to him, as he is

<hi>Supreme immoueable Verity. Charity</hi> relies on his <hi>Goodnes;
Hope</hi> on his <hi>Power; Fayth</hi> on his diuine <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> From
hence it followeth, that <hi>Fayth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the Vertues which Deuines
terme <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed</hi> (that is, which cannot be acquired by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wit, or
induſtry, but are in their Nature &amp; Eſſence, ſupernaturall) it hath
this property; that it is not deſtroied by little and little, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily to
the <hi>Habits,</hi> called <hi>acquiſiti,</hi> that is, <hi>got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by human

they loſt ſucceſſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or by little and little) but it muſt either
be conſerued entire, or wholy deſtroied: And ſince it cannot ſtand
entire with any one act which <pb n="242" facs="tcp:20773:126"/>is directly contrary, it
muſt be totally ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and as it were demoliſhed, and razed by euery
ſuch act. Wherfore, as <hi>Charity</hi> or the Loue of God is expelled from
our ſoule by any one act of <hi>Hatred,</hi> or any other mortall ſinne
againſt his diuine Maieſty: and as <hi>Hope</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied by any one
act of voluntary <hi>Deſperation:</hi> ſo <hi>Fayth</hi> muſt periſh by
any one act of <hi>Hereſy;</hi> becauſe euery ſuch act is directly, and
formally oppoſite therunto. I know that ſome ſinnes which (as Deuines
ſpeake) are <hi>ex genere ſuo,</hi> in in their kind, grieuous and

likewiſe true, that this Rule is not generall for all ſorts of ſinnes;
there being ſome ſo inexcuſably wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of their owne nature, that no

<hi>Hereſy</hi> conſiſts; Let vs come to proue that which we propoſed
in this Chapter. Where I deſire, it be ſtill remembred: That the viſible
Catholique Church cannot erre damnably, as <hi>D. Potter</hi> confeſſeth:
And, that when <hi>Luther</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, there was no other viſible true
Church of Chriſt diſagreeing from the <hi>Roman,</hi> as we haue
demonſtrated in the next precedent Chapter.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Now, that <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; his followers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be excuſed from formall <hi>Hereſy,</hi> I proue by theſe reaſons. To
oppoſe any truth propounded by the viſible true Church as reuealed by God,
is formall <hi>Hereſy,</hi> as we haue ſhewed out of the definition of
<hi>Hereſy:</hi> But <hi>Luther, Caluin,</hi> and the reſt did oppoſe
diuers truths propounded by the viſible Church as reuealed by God; yea they
did <hi>therfore</hi> oppoſe her, becauſe ſhe propounded as diuine
reuealed truths, things which they iudged either to be falſe, or human
inuentions: Therfore they committed formall <hi>Hereſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Moreouer, euery Errour agaynſt any doctrine
reuealed by God, is damnable Hereſy, whether the matter in it ſelfe be
great or ſmall, as I proued before: and therefore eyther the Proteſtants,

all Hereſy, becauſe one of them muſt erre againſt the word &amp;
teſtimony of God: but you grant (perforce) that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
doth not erre damnably; &amp; I add that ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre damnably, becauſe
ſhe is the truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, which you confeſſe cannot erre
damnably: Therefore Proteſtants muſt be guilty of formall
<hi>Hereſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Beſides, we haue ſhewed that the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

that to oppoſe what ſhe deliuereth as reuealed by God, is not ſo much to
oppoſe <hi>her,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> himſelfe; and therefore cannot be

               <p n="16">16. Agayne, If <hi>Luther</hi> were an <hi>Heretique</hi>

in this manner. To ſay, that Gods viſible true Church is not vniuerſal,

orofeſſe to belieue the holy Catholique Church:</hi> And you brand
<hi>Donatus</hi> with hereſy, becauſe he limited the vniuerſal Church to

himſelfe, and other chiefe Proteſtants <pb n="246" facs="tcp:20773:128"/>that

Therfore happy had he been, if he had then, and his followers would now,

conſider, whether you may not be well compared to one <hi>Ticonius</hi> a
<hi>Donatist,</hi> who wrote againſt <hi>Parmenianus</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a
<hi>Donatist,</hi> who blaſphemed, that the Church of Chriſt had periſhed
(as you do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in this your Booke write againſt ſome of your Proteſtant
Brethren, or as you call them Zelots among you, who hold the very ſame or
rather a worſe Hereſy) and yet remained among them, euen after

would proceed agaynſt you if it were in their power) and yet like
<hi>Ticonius</hi> you remaine in their Communion, and come not into that Church
which is, hath been, and ſhall euer be vniuerſall: For which very cauſe
<hi>S. Augustin</hi> complaines of <hi>Ticonius,</hi> that although he wrote
againſt the Donatiſts, yet he was of <hi>an hart</hi>
                  <note n="(z)" place="margin">De doctr. Chriſt. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>30.</hi>

                  <hi>ſo extremely abſurd,</hi> as not to forſake them alto gether. And
ſpeaking of the ſame thing in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="250" facs="tcp:20773:130"/>place he
obſerues, that although <hi>Ticonius</hi> did manifeſtly confute them who
affirmed that the Church had periſhed; yet, <hi>he ſaw not</hi> (ſayth

                  </note> 
                  <hi>he ſhould
haue ſeene, that thoſe Christians of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica belonged to the Church
ſpread ouer the whole world, who remained vnited, not with them who were
diuided from the communion and vnity of the ſame world, but with ſuch as
did communicate with the whole world.</hi> But <hi>Parmenianus, and the rest of
the Donatists ſaw that conſequence, and reſolued rather to ſettle their
mind in obſtinacy against the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest truth which Ticonius maintained,
then by yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therto, to be ouercome by thoſe Churches in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, which
enioyed the communion of that vnity which Ticonius defended, from which they
had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided themſelues.</hi> How fitly theſe words agree to Catholiques in
England in reſpect of the Proteſtants, I deſire the Reader to conſider.
But theſe and the like reſemblances of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to the
<hi>Donatiſtes,</hi> I willingly let paſſe, and onely vrge the maine
point: That ſince <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformed Church was not in being for
diuers Centuries before <hi>Luther,</hi> and yet was (becauſe ſo forſooth
they will needs haue it) in the Apoſtles time, they muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
affirme heretically with the <hi>Donatists,</hi> that the true and vnſpotted
Church of Chriſt peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; &amp; that ſhe which remained on earth was (O
blaſphemy!) an Harlot. Moreouer the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me hereſy followes out of the
doctrine of <hi>D. <pb n="251" facs="tcp:20773:130"/>Potter,</hi> and other Proteſtants,
that the Church may erre in points not fundamentall; becauſe we haue ſhewed
that euery errour againſt any one reuealed truth, is <hi>Hereſy</hi> and
<hi>damnable,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the matter be otherwiſe of it ſelfe, great or
ſmall. And how can the Church more truly be ſayd to periſh, then when
ſhe is permitted to maintaine a <hi>damnable Hereſy?</hi> Beſides, we
will heereafter proue, that by any act of Hereſy all diuine fayth is loſt;
&amp; to imagine a true Church of faithfull perſons without any fayth, is as
much as to fancy a liuing man without life. It is therefore cleere, that
Donatiſt-like they hold that the Church of Chriſt periſhed: yea they are
worſe then the <hi>Donatists,</hi> who ſaid, that the Church remained at
leaſt in <hi>Africa;</hi> whereas Proteſtants muſt of neceſſity be
forced to grant, that for a long ſpace before <hi>Luther,</hi> ſhe was no

that is, by the Pope: Becauſe the whole Church collectiuely doth not meet to
ordayne Biſhops or Prieſts, or to giue them Authority. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to
their owne doctrine, they belieue that the Pope neyther <hi>hath, or ought to
haue any Iuriſdiction, Power, Superiority, Preheminence, or Authority
Eccleſiasticall, or Spirituall within this Realme,</hi> which they ſweare
euen when they are ordained Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons: How then can the

neuer gaue them Authority, to oppoſe Her, by whome it was giuen. But grant,
their firſt Biſhops had ſuch Authority from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>
after the deceaſe of thoſe men, who gaue Authority to their pretended

he haue no ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, how can he giue to others what himſelfe hath
not? Your Ordination, or Conſecration of Biſhops and Prieſts imprinting
no <hi>Character,</hi> can only conſiſt in giuing a Power, Authority,
Iuriſdiction, or (as I ſaid before) ſome kind of Deputation to exerciſe
Epiſcopall, or Prieſtly functions: If then, the temporall Magiſtrate
confers this Power &amp;c. he can, nay he cannot chuſe but Ordaine, and
conſecrate Biſhops, and Prieſts, as often as he confers Authority or

you will be more vnwilling to grant, then well able to auoid, if you will be

receiue any Spirituall Iuriſdiction from any Temporall Prince, and therfore
if Iuriſdiction muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from Princes, he hath none at all: and yet

               </p>
               <p n="26">26. In the beginning of this Chapter I ſhewed, that to

proue to be wanting in the beliefe of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, euen in thoſe points
which are true in themſelues, and to which they yield aſſent, as hapneth
in all thoſe particulars, wherin they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with vs; from whence it will
follow, that they wanting true <hi>Diuine Fayth,</hi> want meanes abſolutely
neceſſary to ſaluation.</p>
               <p n="27">27. And firſt,<note place="margin">The fayth of
Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</note> that their beliefe wanteth
<hi>Certainty,</hi> I proue, becauſe they denying the Vniuerſall
infallibility of the Church, can haue no certaine ground to know what Obiects
are <pb n="270" facs="tcp:20773:140"/>reuealed, or teſtifyed by God. Holy Scripture is in
it ſelfe moſt true and infallible, but-without the direction &amp;
declaration of the Church, we can neyther haue certaine meanes to know what
Scripture is Canonicall; nor what Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations be faythfull; nor what is the
true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Scripture. Euery Proteſtant, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is
perſuaded that his owne opinions, be true, and that he hath vſed ſuch
meanes as are wont to be preſcribed for vnderſtanding the Scripture, as
Prayer, Conferring of diuers Texts &amp;c. and yet their diſagreements ſhew
that ſome of them are deceiued: And therefore it is cleer that they haue no
one certaine ground whereon to relye for vnderſtanding of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And
ſeeing they hold all the Articles of Fayth, euen concerning fundamentall
points, vpon the ſelfe ſame ground of Scripture, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, not by the
Churches Authority, but according to ſome other Rules, which as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of their contradictions teach, do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes fayle; it is cleere that the
ground of their fayth is infallible in no point at all. And albeit ſometyme
it chance to hit on the truth, yet it is likewiſe apt to leade them to
errour: As all Arch-heretiques belieuing ſome truths, and withall diuers
errours vpon the ſame ground and motiue, haue indeed no true diuine
infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fayth, but only a fallible humane opinion, and perſuaſion. For
if the ground vpon which they rely were certaine, it could neuer produce 
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:20773:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>any errour.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Another cauſe of Vncertainty in the fayth of
Proteſtants, muſt riſe from their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of points fundamentall,
and not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall. For ſince they acknowledge, that euery errour in
fundamentall points deſtroieth the ſubſtance of fayth and yet cannot
determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne what points be fundamentall: it followeth that they muſt remaine
vncertayne whether or no they be not in ſome fundamentall errrour, &amp; ſo
want the ſubſtance of fayth, without which there can be no hope of
Saluation.</p>
               <p n="24">24. And that he who erreth againſt any one reuealed
truth (as certainly ſome Proteſtants muſt doe, becauſe contradictory
Propoſitions cannot both be true) doth looſe all <hi>Diuine fayth;</hi> is
a very true doctrine deliuered by Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Deuines, with ſo generall a
conſent, that the contrary is wont to be cenſured as temera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. The
Angelicall Doctour <hi>S. Thomas</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth this Queſtion:
<hi>Whether</hi>
                  <note n="(o)" place="margin">

                  <hi>he who deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one Article of fayth, may retayne fayth of other
Articles?</hi> and reſolueth that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not: which he proueth, <hi>(Argumenta
ſed contra)</hi> becauſe; <hi>As deadly ſinne is oppoſite to Charity;
ſo to deny one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of fayth is oppoſite to fayth: But Charity doth not
remaine with any one deadly ſinne; therefore faith doth not remaine after the
denyall of any one Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of fayth.</hi> Whereof he giues this further
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>the nature of euery habit doth
depend vpon the formall Motiue &amp; Obiect ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <pb n="272" facs="tcp:20773:141"/>which Motiue being taken away the nature of the habit cannot remayne.
But the formall Obiect of faith is the ſupreme truth as it is manifested in
Scriptures, and in the doctrine of the Church, which proceeds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame
ſupreme verity. Whoſoeuer therefore doth not rely vpon the doctrine of the
Church (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the ſupreme Verity manifeſted in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
as vpon an infallible Rule, he hath not the habit of fayth, but belieues
thoſe things which belong to fayth, by ſome other meanes then by fayth: as
if one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hould remember
ſome Concluſion, and not know the reaſon of that demonstration, it is
cleere that he hath not certaine knowledge, but only Opinion. Now it is
manifeſt, that he who relies on the doctrine of the Church, as vpon an
infallible Rule, will yield his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all, that the Church teacheth.
For if among thoſe things, which ſhe teacheth, he hold what he will, and
doth not hold what he will not, he doth not rely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the doctrine of the
Church, as vpon an infallible Rule, but only vpon his owne will. And ſo it is
cleere that an Heretique, who with pertinacity denieth one Article of fayth, is
not ready to follow the doctrine of the Church in all things: And therfore it
is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that whoſoeuer is an Heretique in any one Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of fayth,
concerning other Articles, hath not fayth, but a kind of Opinion, or his owne
will.</hi> Thus far <hi>S. Thomas.</hi> And afterward: <hi>A man doth
belieue</hi>
                  <note n="(q)" place="margin">Ad <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>all the
Articles of fayth for one and the ſelfe ſame reaſon, to wit, for the
Prime Verity propoſed to vs in the Scripture, vnderstood aright according to
the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church: and therfore whoſoeuer fals 
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:20773:141"/>from this reaſon or motiue, is totally depriued of
fayth.</hi> From this true doctrine we are to infer, that to retaine, or want
the ſubſtance of fayth, doth not conſiſt in the matter, or multitude of
the Articles, but in the oppoſition againſt Gods diuine Teſtimony, which
is inuolued in euery leaſt error againſt Fayth. And ſince ſome
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants muſt needs erre, and that they haue no certaine Rule to know,
why rather one then another; it manifeſtly followes that none of them haue
any Certainty for the ſubſtance of their faith in any one point. Moreouer
<hi>D. Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> being forced to confeſſe that the Roman Church wants
not the ſubſtance of fayth; it followes that ſhe doth not erre in any one
point againſt fayth, becauſe as we haue ſeen out of <hi>S. Thomas,</hi>
euery ſuch error deſtroyes the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of fayth. Now if the Roman
Church did not erre in any one point of fayth, it is manifeſt that
Proteſtants erre in all thoſe points wherin they are contrary to her. And
this may ſuffice to proue that the fayth of Proteſtants wants
Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And now for the ſecond Condition of fayth, I ſay:
If Proteſtants haue <hi>Certainty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">They want the
ſecond Condition of Fayth, Obſcurity.</note> they want
<hi>Obſcurity,</hi> and ſo haue not that fayth which, as the Apoſtle
ſaith, is of things <hi>not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,</hi> or not neceſſitating our
Vnderſtanding to an aſſent. For the whole edifice of the fayth of
Proteſtants, is ſetled on theſe two Principles: Theſe particular Bookes
are Canonicall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: <pb n="274" facs="tcp:20773:142"/>And, the ſenſe and meaning
of theſe Canonicall Scriptures, is cleere and euident, at leaſt in all
points neceſſary to Saluation. Now, theſe Principles being once
ſuppoſed, it cleerly followeth, that what Proteſtants belieue as
neceſſary to Saluation, is euidently knowne by them to be <hi>true,</hi> by
this argument: It is <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne</hi> and <hi>euident,</hi> that whatſoeuer
is contayned in the word of God, is true. But it is <hi>certaine</hi> and
<hi>euident,</hi> that theſe Bookes in particular are the word of God:
Therefore it is <hi>certaine</hi> and <hi>euident,</hi> that whatſoeuer is
contayned in theſe Bookes is true. Which <hi>Concluſion</hi> I take for a
<hi>Maior</hi> in a ſecond Argument, and ſay thus: It is <hi>certaine</hi>
and <hi>euident</hi> that whatſouer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in theſe Bookes is true:
but it is <hi>certayne</hi> and <hi>euident,</hi> that ſuch particular
Articles (for example, the Trinity, Incarnation, Originall ſinne &amp;c.) are
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in theſe Bookes: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is <hi>certaine</hi> and
<hi>euident,</hi> that theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Obiects are true. Neyther will it
auaile you to ſay, that the ſayd Principles are not eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by naturall
diſcourſe, but only to <hi>the eye of reaſon cleered by grace,</hi> as
you ſpeake. For ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall euidence, no leſſe (yea rather more)
drawes and excludes <hi>obſcurity,</hi> then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall euidence doth: neyther
can the party ſo enlightned be ſayd voluntarily to captiuate his

is the <hi>formall Obiect,</hi> or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of <hi>Charity,</hi> &amp; for which
all other things are loued, is differently participated by different Obiects;
and therefore the loue we beare to them for Gods ſake, muſt accordingly be
vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. In the vertue of <hi>Fayth,</hi> the caſe is farre otherwiſe;
becauſe all the Obiects, or points which we belieue, do equally participate
the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine <pb n="282" facs="tcp:20773:146"/>Teſtimony, or Reuelation, for which we
belieue a like all things propounded for ſuch. For it is as impoſſible
for God, to ſpeake an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, in a ſmall, as in a great matter. And this
is the ground for which we haue ſo often affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that any leaſt errour
againſt <hi>Fayth,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious to God, and deſtructiue of
Saluation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This order in Charity may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Towards
God; Our owne ſoule; The ſoule of our Neyghbour; Our owne life, or Goods;
and the life or goods of our Neighbour. God is to be beloued aboue all things,
both <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectiue</hi> (as the Deuines ſpeake) that is, we muſt wiſh or

may, but are not bound, to preferre the life and goods of our Neyghbour before
our owne: we are bound to prefer the ſoule of our Neyghbour before our owne
temporall goods or life, if he happen to be in extreme ſpirituall

prefer the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> good of our owne ſoule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both the

its owne Nature, chiefly encline the perſon in whom it reſides, to loue
God, and to be vnited with him: ſo of it ſelfe it enclines him, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
thoſe things wherby the ſaid Vnion with God is effected, rather to
himſelfe then to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it followes, that in things
neceſſary to ſaluation, no man ought in any caſe, or in any reſpect
whatſoeuer, to prefer the ſpirituall good, either of any particular

come to our preſent purpoſe) it is directly againſt the <hi>Order</hi> of
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or againſt Charity as it hath a reference to our ſelues, which
Deuines call <hi>Charitas propria,</hi> to aduenture either the

of any thing repugnant to it, for whatſoeuer reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; &amp;
conſequently, if by liuing out of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church we put our

                  </note>
                  <hi>enter into life, keep the Commandements.</hi> In which kind of things, as
probable ignorance of the Law, or of the Commandement doth excuſe the party
from all faulty breach therof; ſo likewiſe doth it not exclude ſaluation
in caſe of ignorance. Some other things are ſaid to be neceſſary to
ſaluation <hi>neceſsitate medij, finis,</hi> or <hi>ſalutis;</hi>
becauſe they are Meanes appointed by God to attaine our <hi>End</hi> of
eternall <hi>ſaluation,</hi> in ſo ſtrict a manner, that it were
<hi>preſumption</hi> to <hi>hope</hi> for Saluation without them. And as the
former meanes are ſaid to be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> becauſe they are
<hi>commaunded;</hi> ſo the later are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to be
<hi>commaunded,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> that is:
Although there were no other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall precept concerning them; yet
ſuppoſing they be once appointed as meanes abſolutely neceſſary to
ſaluation, there cannot but riſe an obligation of procuring to haue them,
in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that vniuerſall precept of Charity, which obligeth euery man to
procure the ſaluation of his owne ſoule. In this ſort <hi>diuine
infallible Fayth</hi> is neceſſary to ſaluation; as likewiſe repentance
of euery deadly ſinne, and in the doctrine of <pb n="285" facs="tcp:20773:147"/>Catholiques, Baptiſme <hi>in re,</hi> that is, in <hi>act</hi> to
Children, and for thoſe who are come to the vſe of reaſon, <hi>in
voto,</hi> or <hi>harty deſyre,</hi> when they cannot haue it in act. And as
Baptiſme is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for remiſſion of <hi>Originall,</hi> and
<hi>actuall</hi> ſinne committed before it: ſo the Sacrament of
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion,</hi> or Penance is neceſſary <hi>in re,</hi> or <hi>in
vote,</hi> in <hi>act,</hi> or <hi>deſire,</hi> for the remiſſion of
mortall ſinnes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted after Baptiſme. The Miniſter of which Sacrament
of Penance being neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a true Prieſt, true Ordination is
neceſsary in the Church of God for remiſsion of ſinnes by this Sacrament,
as alſo for other ends not belonging to our preſent purpoſe. From hence
it riſeth, that no ignorance, or impoſsibility can ſupply the want of
thoſe meanes which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to ſaluation: As if, for
exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a ſinner depart this world without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe of all
deadly ſinnes, although he dye ſuddenly, or vnexpectedly fall out of his

of Penance, which they deny to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſaluation, either in act,
or in deſire; which error is likewiſe fundamentall, becauſe it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
(as I ſayd) a thing neceſsary to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And for the ſame reaſon,
if their Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Ordination be doubtfull, as certainly it is, they
are in danger to want a meanes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they cannot be ſaued. Neither
ought this rigour to ſeeme ſtrang, or vniuſt: For Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God hauing of

to ſome meanes which in his infinite Wiſedome he thinkes moſt fit; who
can ſay, why doſt thou ſo? Or who can <hi>hope</hi> for that

Maieſty, for vouchſafing to ordaine vs, baſe creatures, to ſo ſublime
an End, by any <hi>meanes</hi> at all.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Out of the foreſayd difference follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another,
that (generally ſpeaking) in things neceſſary only, becauſe they are
commaunded, <pb n="287" facs="tcp:20773:148"/>it is ſufficient for auoydnng ſinne, that
we proceed prudently, and by the conduct of ſome probable opinion, maturely
weighed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by men of vertue, learning, &amp; wiſdom. Neyther are
we alwayes obliged to follow the moſt ſtrict, and ſeuere, or ſecure
part, as long as the doctrine which we imbrace, proceeds vpon ſuch reaſons,
as may warrant it to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, and prudent, though the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part
want not alſo probable grounds. For in humane affaires, and diſcourſe,
euidence and certainty cannot be alwayes expected. But when we treate not
preciſely of auoyding ſin, but moreouer of procuring ſome thing without
which I can not be ſaued; I am obliged by the <hi>Law,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> to procure as great cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as morally I
am able; and am not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low euery probable Opinion, or dictamen, but
<hi>tutiorem partem, the ſafer part,</hi> becauſe if my
<hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi> proue falſe, I ſhall not <hi>probably,</hi> but
<hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly</hi> come ſhort of Saluation. Nay in ſuch caſe, I ſhall
incurre a new ſinne againſt the <hi>Vertue</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> towards
<hi>my ſelfe,</hi> which obligeth euery one not to expoſe his ſoule to
the hazard of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perdition, when it is in his power, with the
aſſiſtance of Gods grace, to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſure. From this very
ground it is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh ſome Deuines be of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it is not a
ſinne to vſe ſome <hi>Matter,</hi> or <hi>Forme</hi> of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
onely probable, if we reſpect preciſely the reuerence or reſpect which is
due to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <pb n="288" facs="tcp:20773:149"/>as they belong to the <hi>Morall

all doe with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent agree, that it is a grieuous offence to vſe a

&amp; with all, that there is a way more ſafe; it will follow out of the
grounds already layd, that they are obliged by the law of Charity to imbrace
that ſafe way.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now, that Proteſtants haue reaſon at leaſt to
doubt in what caſe they ſtand, is deduced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what we haue ſayd, and
proued about the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall infallibility of the Church, and of her being
Iudge of Controuerſies, to whome all Chriſtians ought to ſubmit their
Iudgment (as euen ſome Proteſtants grant,) and whome to oppoſe in any one
of her definitions, is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinne: As alſo from what we haue ſayd
of the <hi>Vnity, Vniuerſality,</hi> and <hi>Viſibility</hi> of the Church,
and of Succeſſion of Perſons, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; Of the Conditions of Diuine

ſayd heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, ſince it is granted that euery Errour in fundamentall
points is damnable, &amp; that they cannot tell in particular, what points be
funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall; it followes that none of them knowes whether he, or his Brethren
do not erre da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, it being certayne that amongſt ſo many

inſtituted for remiſſion of ſinnes, or at leaſt you muſt

the ſafer way to Heauen (not to repeat what hath been already ſayd vpon
diuers occaſions) I will againe put you in mynd, that vnles the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church was the true Church, there was no viſible true Church
vpon Earth. A thing ſo manifeſt, that Proteſtants themſelues
confeſſe that more then one thouſand yeares the <hi>Roman</hi> Church
poſſeſſed the whole world, as we haue ſhewed heertofore, out of their
own<note n="(h)" place="margin">Chap. <hi>5.</hi> num. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> words:
from whence it followes, that vnleſſe Ours be the true Church, you cannot
pretend to any perpetuall viſible Church of your Owne; but Ours doth not
depend on yours, before which it was. And heere I wiſh you to conſider with
feare and trembling; how all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, not one excepted;
that is, thoſe very men whom you muſt hold not to erre damnably in their

with vnanimous conſent belieue, and profeſse that Proteſtancy vnrepented,
deſtroies Saluation; and then tell me, as you will anſwere at the laſt

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it grounded vpon your <hi>Charitable Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (as you<note n="(l)" place="margin">Pag. <hi>81.</hi>
                  </note> ſpeake) but vpon an ineuitable

haue no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till <hi>Luther,</hi> vnles ours be ſuppoſed to haue been

purpoſe: Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques neuer granted that the Donatiſts had a true Church,
or might be ſaued: And therfore you hauing cited out of <hi>S. Augustin,</hi>
the words of the Catholiques, that the Donatiſts had true

Argument to haue <hi>quinque ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minos;</hi> without which Addition you did

<hi>125.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Catholique Church:</hi> and conſequently, you cannot
allow ſaluation to them, as you do, and muſt do to vs. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the
<hi>Donatists</hi> could not make the like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt Catholiques, as
Catholiques make againſt you, who grant vs Saluation, which we deny to you.
But at leaſt (you will ſay) this Argument for the Certainty of their 
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:20773:151"/>Baptiſme, was like to Ours touching the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and
Certainty of our ſaluation; &amp; therfore that Catholiques ſhould haue
eſteemed the Baptiſme of the Donatiſts, more Certaine then their owne,
and ſo haue allowed Rebaptization of ſuch as were baptized by Heretiques,
or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as the Donatiſts eſteemed all Catholiques to be. I
anſwere, no. Becauſe it being a matter of fayth, that Baptiſme
adminiſtred by Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, obſeruing due Matter, Forme &amp;c. is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide;
to rebaptize any ſo baptized, had beene both a ſacriledge in reitering a
Sacrament not reiterable, and a profeſſion alſo of a damnable Hereſy,
and therfore had not been more <hi>ſafe,</hi> but certainly
<hi>damnable.</hi> But you confeſse that in the doctrine or practiſe of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, there is no beliefe, or profeſſion of any damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
errour, which if there were, euen your Church ſhould certainly be no Church.
To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue therfore and profeſse as we do, cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Saluation, as
Rebaptization muſt haue done. But if the <hi>Donatists</hi> could haue
affirmed with truth, that in the opinion both of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and themſelues
their Baptiſme was good, yea and good in ſuch ſort as that vnles theirs
was good, that of the Catholiques could not be ſuch: but the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s might be good, though that of
the Catholiques were not and further that it was no damnable error to belieue,
that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme adminiſtred by the Catholiques was not good, nor that it was
any Sacriledge to reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <pb n="264" facs="tcp:20773:152"/>the ſame Baptiſme of
Catholiques: If, I ſay, they could haue truly affirmed theſe things, they
had ſaid ſomewhat, which at leaſt had ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the purpoſe. But
theſe things they could not ſay with any colour of truth, and therfore
their argument was fond, and impious. But we with truth ſay to Proteſtants:
You cannot but confeſſe that our doctrine containes no dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable error, and
that our Church is ſo certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a true Church, that vnleſse ours be true
you cannot pretend any; Yea you grant, that you ſhould be guilty of
Schiſme, if you did cut off our Church from the Body of Chriſt, and the
hope of ſaluation: But we neither do, nor can grant that yours is a true
Church, or that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it there is hope of ſaluation: <hi>Therfore it is
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest</hi> for you, <hi>to ioyne with vs.</hi> And now againſt whom hath
your Obiection greateſt force?</p>
               <p n="9">9. But I wonder not a little, and ſo I thinke will euery
body elſe, what the reaſon may be, that you do not ſo much as goe about
to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were the argument of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> which you ſay is all
one with Ours, but refer vs to <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> there to read it; as if
euery one caried with him a Library, or were able to examine the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in
<hi>S. Augustine:</hi> and yet you might be ſure your Reader would be greedy
to ſee ſome ſolid anſwere to an Argument ſo often vrged by vs, and
which indeed, vnles you can confute it, ought alone to moue euery one who hath
care of his ſoule, to take the ſafeſt way, by incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating 
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:20773:152"/>himſelfe in our Church. But we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily imagine
the true reaſon of your ſilence. For the anſwere which <hi>S.
Auguſtine</hi> giues to the <hi>Donatists,</hi> is directly againſt your
ſelfe, and the ſame which I haue giuen: Namely, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques<note n="(o)" place="margin">Ad lit. Petil. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>108.</hi>
                  </note>
approue the Baptiſme of Donatiſts, but abhor their hereſy of
Rebaptization. And that as gold is good (which is the ſimilitude v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by<note n="(p)" place="margin">Contrae Creſc lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap.
<hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>) yet not to be ſought in company
of theeues; ſo though Baptiſme be good, yet it muſt not be ſought for
in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticle of <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> But you free vs from dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
hereſy, and yield vs ſaluation, which I hope is to be imbraced in
whatſoeuer Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it is found, or rather that Company is to be imbraced
before all other, in which all ſides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that ſaluation may be found.
We therfore muſt infer, that it is ſafeſt for you to ſeeke ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
among vs. You had good reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale <hi>S. Augustins</hi> anſwere to
the <hi>Donatists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. You frame another argument in our behalfe, &amp; make

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Religion</hi> of Catholiques, <hi>to
be a ſafe way to Heauen, why do they not follow it?</hi> Which wiſe
argument of your owne, you anſwere at large, and confirme your anſwere by
this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: <hi>The Ieſuits and Dominicans hold different Opinions
touching Predetermination, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception of the Bleſſed
Virgin: Yet ſo, that the Ieſuits hold the Dominicans way ſafe, that is,
his errour not damnable, and the Dominicans hold the <pb n="296" facs="tcp:20773:153"/>ſame of the Ieſuits. Yet neither of them with good Conſequence
can preſſe the other to belieue his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe by his owne
Confeſsion it is no damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. But what Catholique maketh ſuch a wiſe demaund,
as you put into our mouths? If our Religion be a ſafe way to heauen, that is,
not da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable; why do you not follow it? As if euery thing that is good, muſt
be of neceſſity imbraced by euery body But what thinke you of the Argument
framed thus? Our Religion is ſafe, euen by your Confeſſion, therfore you
ought to grant that all <hi>may</hi> imbrace it. And yet further, thus: Among
different Religions and <hi>contrary</hi> wayes to heauen, one only can be
ſafe: But Ours, by your owne Confeſſion, is ſafe, wheras we hold that
in yours there is no hope of ſaluation: Therfore you <hi>may,</hi> and
<hi>ought</hi> to imbrace ours. This is our Argument. And if the Dominicans and
Ieſuits did ſay one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as we ſay to you; then one of them might
with good conſequence preſse <hi>the other to belieue his opinion.</hi> You
haue ſtill the hard fortune to be beaten with your owne weapon.</p>
               <p n="12">12. It remaineth then that both in regard of
<hi>Fayth,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> Proteſtants are obliged to vnite
themſelues with the Church of Rome. And I may add alſo, in regard of the
<hi>Theologicall</hi> Vertue of <hi>Hope,</hi> without which none can hope to
be ſaued, and which you want, either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſse of <hi>Confidence,</hi> or
defect by <hi>Deſpaire,</hi> not <pb n="297" facs="tcp:20773:153"/>vnlike to your
<hi>Fayth,</hi> which I ſhewed to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deficient in <hi>Certainty,</hi>
or exceſſiue in <hi>Eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> as likewiſe according to the rigid
Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, it is either ſo ſtrong, that once had, it can neuer be
loſt; or ſo more then weake, and ſo much nothing; that it can neuer be
gotten. For the true Theologicall <hi>Hope</hi> of Chriſtians, is a
<hi>Hope</hi> which keepes a meane betweene <hi>Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> and
<hi>Deſperation;</hi> which moues vs to worke our ſaluation with feare, and
trembling; which conducts vs to make ſure our ſaluation by good workes, as
holy Scripture aduiſeth But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, Proteſtants do either exclude
<hi>Hope</hi> by <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire,</hi> with the Doctrine that our Sauiour died
not for all, and that ſuch want grace ſufficient to ſaluation; or elſe
by vaine <hi>Preſumption</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon a fantaſticall perſuaſion,
that they are Predeſtinate, which Fayth muſt exclude all feare, and
trembling. Neither can they make their Calling <hi>certaine by good
workes,</hi> who do certainly belieue that before any good workes they are
iuſtified, and iuſtified euen by Fayth alone, and by that Faith wherby they
certainly belieue that they are iuſtifyed. Which points ſome Proteſtants
do expreſly affirme to be <hi>the ſoule of the Church; the principall
Origen of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; Of all other points of Doctrine the chiefeſt and
weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt;</hi> as already I haue noted <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 19.
And if ſome Proteſtants do now relent from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the aforeſaid
doctrine, we muſt affirme, that at leaſt ſome of them want the
Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <pb n="298" facs="tcp:20773:154"/>Vertue of <hi>Hope;</hi> yea that none of
them can haue true <hi>Hope,</hi> while they hope to be ſaued in the
Communion of thoſe, who defend ſuch doctrines, as doe directly ouerthrow
all true Chriſtian <hi>Hope.</hi> And for as much as concernes
<hi>Fayth,</hi> we muſt alſo infer, that they want <hi>Vnity</hi> therin
(and conſequently haue none at all) by their diſagreement about <hi>the
ſoule of the Church; the principall Origen of ſaluation; of all other
points of Doctrine the chiefest and weightiest.</hi> And if you want true
<hi>Fayth,</hi> you muſt by conſequence want <hi>Hope;</hi> or if you hold
that this <hi>point</hi> is not to be ſo indiuiſible on either ſide, but
that it hath latitude ſufficient to imbrace all parties, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice
to their ſaluation; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that your Brethren hold it to be
<hi>the ſoule of the Church &amp;c.</hi> I muſt repeate what I haue ſaid
heertofore, that, euen by this Example, it is cleere, you cannot agree what
points be <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall:</hi> And ſo (to whatſoeuer anſwere you fly)
I preſſe you in the ſame manner, and ſay, that you haue no Certainty
whether you agree in fundamentall points, or Vnity and ſubſtance of Fayth,
which cannot ſtand with difference in fundamentall. And ſo vpon the whole
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I leaue it to be conſidered, whether, <hi>Want of Charity can be
iustly charged</hi> on vs, becauſe we affirme, that they cannot (without
repentance) be ſaued, who want of all other the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary meanes
to ſaluation, which are, the three <hi>Theologicall</hi> Vertues, <hi>FAITH,

according to good conſcience, his eſtate without asking him leaue, was by
the Law of God obnoxious to reſtitution, and ought to haue been applyed to
pious vſes? Whereas both anciently in this Countrey, and at all tymes, and
ſpecially in this laſt age, men ſee aboundance of heroicall actions of
this kind performed in forrayne parts. And if it were not for feare of noting
many other great Citties, as if there were any want of moſt munificent
Hoſpitalls in them, wherein they abound; I could tell you of one 
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20773:157"/>called the <hi>Annunciata</hi> in the Citty of

it, where the perſons of thoſe poore creatures are kept, and where they are
defrayed of all their neceſſary charges euery weeke. I could alſo tell
you of an Hoſpitall in <hi>Rome</hi> called <hi>S. Spirito</hi> of huge
reuenewes, but it is not my meaning to enter into particulars, which would
proue endles. In the meane time it is prety entertainment for you to belieue no
more then you ſee, which is not much, and to talke in generall termes, by
comparing that which comes in your way, with thoſe which are in other
Countries, wherof you ſeeme to know very little. And where I pray you can you
verify that which <hi>Charity Mistaken</hi> ſayth of our Church in theſe
words. (<hi>pag.</hi> 7.) <hi>Perſons ſicke of all diſeaſes are
ſerued and attended (after the example of Christ our Lord) by the owne hands
of great Princes and Prelates, and of choyce and delicate Ladies and Queenes,

Head of your Church had not deſtroyed thoſe innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable glorious monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
of Charity which he found! But becauſe our preſent queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20773:158"/>the Saueablenes of Proteſtants belongeth rather to Faith
then Charity, out of your owne hyperbolicall affirmation. I will infer: That
ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Monuments of Charitable workes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Catholiques, do
incomparably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thoſe of yours; and yet, that time for time your Charity
(as you affirme) ſurpaſseth ours; it followes very cleerly, that our Fayth
and Church is far more ancient then yours, and conſequently that yours cannot
be <hi>Catholique</hi> for all Ages. So that by exaggeration of your
<hi>Charity,</hi> you haue ouerthrowne your <hi>Fayth</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi>
alſo, which cannot ſubſiſt without true <hi>Catholique Fayth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. But yet you are ſo ingenuous, that you do not ſo
much as pretend to compare your Charity in conuerting ſoules, to that of the
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques: nor do you ſo much as once venture to inſinuate that the
Proteſtant Miniſters leaue their Countrey and Commodities, and the howſes
of rich and louing friends, to tranſport themſelues into barbarous Nations,
with the ſufferance of all cruell inconueniences, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many times of
death it ſelfe, for the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſoules to Chriſt our Lord. For
of this you were expreſſely tould, and conſequently how improbable it
was, that Catholiques ſhould ſeare the daungerous ſtate of Proteſtants,
through meere want of Charity; wheras yet for the only exerciſe of that
vertue, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſo much courage and ioy to caſt away 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20773:158"/>their liues, &amp; that therfore when we made that iudgment
of you, it was rather through our zeale and cordiall deſire of your good, and
feare of your loſſe, then for want of charity, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. But of
this, as I was ſaying, you were ſo wiſe as not to ſpeake a word. For
that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious marke of the Dilatation and Amplitude of Gods Church, by the
Conuerſion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Kings, and Kingdomes, ſo manifeſtly foretold by
the holy Prophets, and ordained in the Goſpell, when our Sauiour bid the
Apoſtles preach to all Nations, and yet neuer performed by Proteſtants, by

read miſſion of the Ieſuites into <hi>France.</hi> So far was he from
<hi>collecting from their doctrine &amp; practiſes, that they belieue neither
in Ieſus Christ, nor in the Pope.</hi> And as for our doctrine, which
concernes the incompatibility of Proteſtancy with ſaluation, as proper to
the Ieſuites, it is an idle ſpeach, void of all colour of truth. For it is
ſo far from being proper to them, that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Roman Catholiques

Greeke word is called Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique: and according to this acception of the Word,
the Roman Church is not the Vniuerſall Church, but part of the Vniuerſall
Church: Yet the first and chiefe part, as the head in the body; becauſe in
her, fulnes of power doth exist, but only a part of fulnes is deriued to
others. And that One Church, which containes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſelfe all Churches, is
ſaid to be the Vniuerſall Church. And according to this ſignification of
the Word, only the Roman Church is called the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church, becauſe
ſhe alone is preferred before the rest by priuiledge of ſinguler dignity.
As God is called the vniuerſall Lord, not becauſe he is diuided into
ſpecies &amp;c. but becauſe all things are contained vnder his Dominion:
For there is One generall Church of which Truth it ſelfe ſaid to Peter;
Thou art Peter and vpon this Rocke &amp;c. And the many particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
of which the Apostle ſayth, Instantia mea &amp;c. One doth conſist of all,
as the generall of particulars, &amp; One hath the preeminence before all,
becauſe ſeing there is one Body of the Church, of which the Apostle
ſayth; We are all one Body in Christ: ſhe excels the rest, as the Head
excels the other members of the body.</hi> Thus far <hi>Innocentius;</hi> who
as you ſee teacheth that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the Head of all
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: That although the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in one 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20773:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſenſe be a particular Church, yet in another
ſenſe it both is, and ought to be called the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Church; and
finally that your Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about the repugnance betwixt the terme
<hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> is friuolous, as he explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
very well by the example of Almighty God, who is ſaid to be an
<hi>Vniuerſall</hi> Cauſe, and yet had neyther <hi>genus,</hi> nor
<hi>ſpecies,</hi> and beſids whom there are other particular Cauſes. Is
this to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, as you ſay, that the Roman Church is a <hi>topycall, or
particular Church in, and vnder the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall? Or that ſhe is onely

<hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Fayth,</hi> and of the <hi>Church.</hi> And; That,
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the true Viſible Church is ſo far neceſsary, that all
voluntary error againſt her definitions, as <hi>Hereſy</hi> is, and all
diuiſion from her outward Society, which is <hi>Schiſme,</hi> excludes
ſaluation. By theſe Rules, <hi>we</hi> can certainly know what is damnable
<hi>Schiſme,</hi> and <hi>Hereſy;</hi> whereas <hi>you,</hi> placing the
Vnity of <hi>Fayth,</hi> and truth of a Church in the beliefe of points, which

Moreouer, if you meaſure the Nature, and Vnity of fayth, not by the
<hi>formall motiue,</hi> for which we belieue, to wit, the Word, or Reuelation
of God, but by the weight of the particular obiects which are belieued, you
will not be able to ſhew, that he who erreth in ſome one, or more
fundamentall points, doth looſe diuine infallible fayth in reſpect of
thoſe other truths which he belieues: and by this meanes, Perſons
diſagreeinge, euen in <hi>Fundamentall</hi> points, may retaine the ſame
ſubſtance or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of fayth, and be of the ſelfe ſame true
Church; which is moſt abſurd, &amp; makes a faire way to affirme, that
Iewes, and Turkes are of the ſame Church with Chriſtians, becauſe they
all agree in the beliefe of one God. And thus we <pb n="19" facs="tcp:20773:164"/>haue

                  <hi>the Ancient

opinion of the Greeke Church at this day) that all the ſpirits of the

the <hi>Councell,</hi> that <hi>Declaratum fuit &amp;c. It was at length
declared, that the Saints haue both attained, and not attained Perfect

with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when they ſhall shine as the ſunne.</hi> And it is to

the Councell, and ſo it was done with the common conſent of the
Grecians.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And heere let me put you in mind, that if the
<hi>Hereſy</hi> of <hi>Aërius,</hi> (whether you take it in our, or your

ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring of Infidelity, as if the Saints could be depriued of Beatitude

that the Grecians do not altogether take away ſome kind of Purging fire, but
only ſeeme to deny a certaine determinate puniſhment of corporall fire,
<hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>they do truly offer Sacrifice and Prayers
to God for the dead, ſurely not for the Bleſſed, nor for thoſe which be
damned in Hell, which were plainely abſurd and impious: it must therfore be
for them, who are deceaſed with fayth and Piety, but haue not fully
ſatisfied for the temporall puniſhment due to their ſinnes.</hi> Is this
to condemne the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Antiquity as abſurd, and impious? Did Antiquity
offer Sacrifice, and Prayers for the damned Ghoſts, or for the Saints to

that <hi>Aërius</hi> was condemned by the Church, and was reckoned among

Obiects of fayth, a man is not bound to belieue them explicitely, but only
implicitely, or in readines of mind, for as much as he is ready to belieue
whatſoeuer the holy Scripture containes: But he is bound to belieue them
explicitely, only when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to him that it is contained in the doctrine

ſuch dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce vpon you. Nay, the ſame Confeſſion which acquits vs,
condemnes your ſelues. For while you confeſſe a Reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Old
Church, and neyther doe, nor can ſpecify any Viſible Church, which in your
opinion needed no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; you muſt affirme, that the Church which you
intended to reforme, was indeed the Viſible Catholique Church; if ſo, then
you cannot deny but that you departed from the Catholique Church, &amp; are
guilty of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> yea and of <hi>Hereſy.</hi> For if the
<hi>Catholique</hi> Church was infected with erroneous doctrine which nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20773:186"/>Reformation; it followes, that the errours were
<hi>Vniuerſall,</hi> and that the Reformation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming after thoſe errours,
muſt want <hi>Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality</hi> of <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Tyme,</hi> and
therefore be bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the marke of <hi>Hereſy.</hi> For in true
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity a <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>no</hi> Church are all one. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the

<hi>fayth,</hi> it is impoſſible to alter any leſt point of fayth,
without changing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Church, and Religion; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to reforme the Church in matters of faith, is as if you ſhould reforme a man
by depriuing him of a reaſonable Soule, whereby he is a man; And a
<hi>Reformed Catholique</hi> are termes no leſſe repugnant, then a
reaſonable vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature, or a deſtroied exiſting thing.
Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay, the <hi>Reformation</hi> did not <hi>change the
ſubstance</hi> of Religion, but only <hi>cleanſed it from corrupt and
impure qualities,</hi> are meer wordes to deceaue ſimple ſoules. And it is
a lamentable caſe, that you can neuer be brought from ſuch ridiculous
ſimilitudes, as heere you bring of <hi>Naaman,</hi> who was ſtil the ſame
man before and after he was cured of his leproſy; Of a field o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergrowne with
weeds, thiſtles &amp;c. (and your Brethren are full of twenty ſuch
childiſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended illuſtrations:) whereas euery body knowes that
leproſy is accidental to a man, and weeds to a field, but Fayth is
eſſentiall to the Church; and that <hi>Affirmation,</hi> or

Fayth it ſelfe being an <hi>accident</hi> and <hi>quality</hi>
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in <hi>Affirmation,</hi> or <hi>Negation;</hi> to cleanſe it
from the <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>impure quality</hi> of <hi>affirming,</hi> or

<hi>Eſſence;</hi> which is not to <hi>reforme,</hi> but to
<hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy</hi> it. Laſtly, from this your forced Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not to
<hi>erect a new Church, but to purge the Old,</hi> we muſt inferre that the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, which you ſought to <hi>purge,</hi> was the
<hi>Old</hi> Church, and the Catholike Church of Chriſt. For if you found any

powerfull to condemne your ſelues, who were not content to keep within
thoſe generall bounds, which you confeſſe we belieued, but would attempt
new Reformations, although with ſo wofull Schiſmes and Ruptures of
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, as you hold worthy to be lamented with teares of bloud! If our
errors were not fundamentall, your Reformation could not be neceſſary to
ſaluation; as when the wound or diſeaſe is knowne not to be deadly, the

               <p n="3">3. The Reformation which zealous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques did
deſire, and with whoſe words you vainely load your Margent, were not in

ſhall remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forſaken. But of this I haue ſpoken in the <hi>Firſt
Part. Luther</hi> was iuſtly cut of by <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as a
pernicious member: which yet was not done, till the Pope had vſed all meanes
to reclaime him. Prouincial or Nationall Synods may ſeeke to reforme abuſes
in manners, and endeauour that the fayth already eſtabliſhed be
conſerued: but if they go about to reforme the Catholique Church in any one
point, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the name of Conuenticles, and not of Councels.</p>

               <p n="6">6. You pretend they are <hi>doubtfull,</hi> and ſay:
<hi>The Roman Doctours doe not fully and abſolutly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in any one point
among themſelues, but only in ſuch points wherin they agree with vs.</hi>
If a manifeſt vntruth be a good proofe, your Argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth. If you
thinke, that diſagreement in matters not defined by the Church, argues
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in matters of fayth, you ſhew ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in our Deuines,
who euen in all thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles wherein you agree with vs, haue many
different, and contrary Opinions concerning points not defined: as about ſome
ſpeculatiue queſtions concerning the Deity, the Bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
Incarnation; yea there are more diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thoſe high Myſteries
wherin you agree with vs, then in others wherin we diſagree: and yet you
grant, that ſuch diſputes do not argue thoſe maine points to be
doubtfull. And ſo you muſt anſwere your owne inſtance, by which you
might as well proue, that Philoſophers do not agree whether there be ſuch
things as <hi>Time, Motion, Quantity, Heauens, Elements, &amp;c.</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <pb n="67" facs="tcp:20773:188"/>in many particulars concerning thoſe things,

               <p n="7">7. In the ſecond place you affirme our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to be

is very cleerly nothing at all to the purpoſe. For our Queſtion is not what
euery one is obliged <hi>explicitely to belieue,</hi> but whether euery one be
not obliged, <hi>not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belieue,</hi> or deny any one point

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20773:189"/>the contrary, namely; that the Apoſtles preached to all,
ſome things which were not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but only
<hi>profitable</hi> to <hi>all</hi> (and therfore not <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> as
you ſay;) whereas yet he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely affirmes the knowledge of the Creed,
commandments, and ſome ſacraments to be <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> to
<hi>all.</hi> I wonder what pleaſure you can take in corrupting Authors, to
your owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit? Now ſince we muſt haue, as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
rightly teacheth, <hi>a will ready to imbrace whatſoeuer is propounded by the

The very oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and end for which it was framed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of an
<hi>Hereticall</hi> ſpirit, to oppoſe the true Viſible Church: It was
turned into Engliſh vpon an hereticall perſwaſion, and a popular
inſinuation, and a crafty affectation to inueigle the humor of the people,
that publique Prayers were vnlawfull in an vnknowne tongue. It lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth out
Prayers both <hi>for</hi> deceaſed ſinners, and <hi>to</hi> glorious
Saints, blotting diuers of them out of their Calendar; and hath abrogated their
fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiuall dayes: and the like they haue done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faſts, except
thoſe few which they vouchſafe to like: It aboliſheth all memory of
<hi>S. Peters</hi> Succeſsour: It treateth only of two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20773:189"/>excluding the reſt; and in the one it omitteth moſt of
our Ceremonies, as ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: in the other it profeſseth not to giue
any thing but the ſubſtance of Bread and wine. It adminiſtreth to Lay
people both kinds, as <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> by the <hi>institution</hi> of
Chriſt our Lord: Maſse, or Sacrifice it hath none: It reades and belieues
Scripture heretically tranſlated: It mentioneth no Reliques of Saints: And in
a word, it is both in the whole Body, and deſigne, and in euery point a
profeſſion of a Church, and fayth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Catholiques, and implies a
condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Liturgy</hi> as <hi>ſuperstitious,</hi> &amp; your
ſelfe boldly ſay: <hi>We cannot, we</hi>
                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">Pag.

<hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>fayth.</hi> I ſaid that I had no deſire to
examine the particulars of your Liturgy, neither is it needfull. For we may
iudge of the reſt, by the very firſt words, or Introite of your Seruice,
beginning with a Text, for which you cite <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. <hi>At what time
ſoeuer a ſinner doth repent him of his ſinnes from the bottome of his
heart, I will put all his wickednes out of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, ſayth the
Lord.</hi> But there is no ſuch ſentence in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> whoſe
words are theſe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the Bible of the Proteſtants: <hi>But if the
wicked will turne from all his ſinnes which he hath committed, and keep all
my statutes, and do that <pb n="70" facs="tcp:20773:190"/>which is lawfull and right, he
shall ſurely liue, he shall not die: All his Tranſgreſsions which he hath
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they shall not be mentioned vnto him: in the righteouſnes which
he hath done, he shall liue.</hi> Your firſt Reformers, the <hi>ſoule</hi>
of whoſe Church was <hi>ſolifidian</hi> Iuſtification, were loth to heare
of poſſibility to keep all the Commandments, of working Righteouſnes, or
liuing in the Righteouſnes which he hath wrought; as alſo they were
vnwilling to particularize with the <hi>Prophet,</hi> what is required to true
<hi>Repentance,</hi> knowing full well, the different opinions of their firſt
Progenitors about this point of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and therfore they thought
beſt to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt this Text. And which is more ſtrange, in your
ſeruice-Booke tranſlated into Latin, and printed in <hi>London, Per
aſsignationem Franciſci Florae,</hi> the ſentence is cited at large as it
is in the Prophet, and therfore the corruption ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning in the
Engliſh to deceiue the Vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is more inexcuſable. Neither (in the
ſame Introite) is the allegation of <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2. much more truly made:
<hi>Rent your hearts, &amp; not your garments, and turne to the Lord your God
&amp;c.</hi> Out of which place, you know men are wont to declaime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our corporall Penance of Faſting, Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, Hayre-cloth, Diſciplines
&amp;c. but, euen according to your owne Tranſlation, the words are:
<hi>Turne you euen to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with
weeping, and with mourning; And rent your hearts, and not your garments
&amp;c.</hi> 
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:20773:190"/>where I belieue you will confeſſe that
your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was not vſed to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. You ſpeake among other things of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; we
grant that <hi>God may be worſhipped with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Image.</hi> But we ſay,
that he cannot be truly worſhipped by any one, who denieth worſhip of
Images, becauſe true worſhip of God cannot ſtand with any one
<hi>Hereſy.</hi> It is highly good, &amp; lawfull, and a moſt holy thing to
pray to God; but yet if one ſhould belieue, that we may not alſo pray to
liuing men, your ſelfe would I thinke condemne him for an <hi>Heretique,</hi>
becauſe all Chriſtians intreate their Brethren to pray for them: By which
example all your inſtances (<hi>pag.</hi> 72.) may be anſwered. Your
ſaying out of <hi>Bellarminine</hi> that the worſhip, and Inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
Saints was brought into the Church, <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by custom then any
Precept,</hi> is anſwered heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after <hi>n.</hi> 12. And I would gladly know
by what authority your Church can inioyne ſecret Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in ſome
caſe, as (heere <hi>pag.</hi> 72.) you ſay ſhe doth, if Chriſt haue
left it free? Can a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane law oblige men to reueale their ſecret ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
in Confeſſion? eſpecially ſince they know not whether your Miniſters
will not thinke themſelues obliged to acquaint ſome Officer therewith, in
caſe the Penitent diſcloſe any cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me puniſhable by the Lawes of the
Realme. To which propoſe I could tell you ſtrange and true ſtories: as
contrarily becauſe Catholikes belieue the Sacrament of Confeſſion to haue
been inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted <pb n="72" facs="tcp:20773:191"/>by our Sauiour Chriſt, as
neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, they conſequently teach, that the Seale and
Secret thereof is ſo ſacred and inuiolable, that the Pope himſelfe cannot
diſpenſe therein, though it were to ſaue his owne life. And now, to
follow your wandrings, you may know that we doe not hinder, but giue free leaue
to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned perſons to ſay their prayers in a known language: but the
Church doth celebrate pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique Seruice in one of the learned Tongues, for
weighty reaſons, which haue been learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe by our Catholique
Writers. And if nothing muſt be read but what the People, yea learned men
vnderſtand, you muſt giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reading in publique, euen in Engliſh,
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the Prophets, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyps, and other
parts of Scriptures, the ſenſe and meaning wherof the people vnderſtand
no more, then if they were read in Hebrew. Nay, to vnderſtand the words, and
not the ſenſe, is not free from danger, becauſe they may by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conceaue
ſome errour, as we daily ſee by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Sectaries, &amp; in that
vngracious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who lately out of Scripture, as he thought, murthered his
Mother, and Brother, for being cauſe of his Idolatry in kneeling at the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Happy had it beene both for him, and a thouſand more, if the
ſacred Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in Engliſh were not ſo common among them, but were
read with due circumſpection, and not without approbation of ſuch as can

Scripture doth recommend to vs the Church, and diuine vnwritten Traditions.
Neither can you alleage any one Catholique Author, ancient or moderne, who

ſome Proteſtants for that cauſe; as likewiſe for the ſame reaſon
ſome chiefe Proteſtants haue blamed <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus, Origen,
Epiphanius, Ambroſe, Hierome, Maximus, Theophilus, Damaſcene,

Scripture, and Church be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in what they deliuer? Doth not your

the ſame points the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is alſo ſufficient, and cleere? Which

Scriptures, which the Church deliuers as the word of God. Thirdly, vpon all

of a Chriſtian findes not in all this, any ſure ground wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on finally to
reſt, or ſettle it ſelfe:</hi> Becauſe, diuine <hi>Fayth</hi> requires
a Teſtimony <hi>abſolutely diuine,</hi> and yet, <hi>our Aduerſaries
yield that the Testimony of the preſent Church is not abſolutely
diuine,</hi> (to which purpoſe you cite in your Margent ſome of our

               <p n="7">7. This your diſcourſe is neither pertinent, nor true.
For the Queſtion is not, as I haue often told you, whether or no, our fayth
be reſolued into the Authority of the Church: but whether we may not truly
infer, that whoſoeuer reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the Church in thoſe points which ſhe
doth <hi>infallibly</hi> propoſe as reuealed by God (which
<hi>infallibility</hi> you yield to her for all fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points) be not an

comes to oppoſe the <hi>Testimony</hi> or <hi>Reuclation</hi> of

Nouices, who by you are taught to belieue that ſhe may erre (vnles you will
circumuent them, by diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her fallibility) they will haue wit inough
to tell themſelues, that ſince ſhe may erre, and ſpeakes but
<hi>probably,</hi> ſhe cannot worke ſo <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> vpon them, but
that they may ſtill doubt whether ſhe do not actually erre, and deceiue
them. And how can the Church worke vpon all <hi>within</hi> her, to

ſee then, that the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church in ſome ſenſe is
<hi>Diuine,</hi> that is, infallibly directed by the holy Ghoſt; which is
inough for our purpoſe, although it be not <hi>Diuine</hi> in another
ſenſe, that is, her words are not the immediate voyce of God, as
Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are, becauſe ſhe doth not propoſe any new Reuelations, made
immediately to her, but only infallibly declares what Reuelations haue beene
made to Prophets, Apoſtles, &amp;c. Your ſelfe affirme, that the Church is
infallible in <hi>Fundamentall</hi> points, and conſequently her Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
is not meerly <hi>humane</hi> and fallible, and yet it is not abſolutely

that the Church being infallible in ſome points, may be to vs a ground
ſufficient for our infallible aſſent, or beliefe for ſuch Articles. And
if you will tell vs that fayth muſt be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into ſome Authority
which is abſolutely <pb n="110" facs="tcp:20773:210"/>
                  <hi>Diuine,</hi> as <hi>Diuine</hi>
ſignifies that which is diſtinct from all things <hi>created,</hi> you will
find your ſelfe gone too far. For Scripture it ſelfe, being a thing
created, and not a God, is not Deuine in that ſenſe. And the Apoſtles,
who receiued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Reuelations from God, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they did preach,

by God: And yet I hope you will not hence inferre, that it had not been

although they did not preach new Reuelations, but only declare, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound

affirme that Scripture is certainely, and euidently knowne by Scripture? Or

which are, <hi>The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſelfe witneſseth;</hi> he adds theſe (which
you as you are wont, leaue out) <hi>whoſe predictions of things to come if

not the Scripture <hi>by that beame of light which euidenly ſhines in

ſuppoſes, then the Propoſall of the Church cannot make any vnwritten
Verity to become matter of fayth: yet to ſalue the ſoueraigne power of his
Church, he makes all the ſtrength, and truth in this Syllogiſme to depend

                  <hi>vpon the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church,
then it depends vpon the word of men, and therfore doth rely vpon a most weake

of the Councell or Pope, when he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth as out of his Chaire, is not meerly
the word of man; that is, a word ſubiect to error, but in ſome ſort the
word of God; that is, vttered by the aſsistance, and direction of the holy
Ghost: nay I ſay, that the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques are thoſe who indeed leane on a
rotten staffe:</hi> And then he comes to the words which you ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: <hi>For we
must know that a Propoſition of Fayth is concluded in this Syllogiſme:
Whatſoeuer God hath <pb n="120" facs="tcp:20773:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>reuealed in Scripture is
true: God hath reuealed this in Scripture: ergo it is true. Of the
premiſſes in this Syllogiſme, the first is most certaine among all; the
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is moſt firme, or certaine among Catholiques, for it relies on the
Testimony of the Church, Councell, or Pope</hi> (heere you breake off, but
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> ads) <hi>of which we haue in holy Scripture manifeſt
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that they cannot erre. Act.</hi> 15. <hi>It hath ſeemed to the
Holy Ghoſt, &amp; to vs: And Luke</hi> 22. <hi>I haue prayed for thee, that
thy fayth may not faile. But amongſt Heretiques it doth rely only vpon
coniectures, or the Iudgement of ones own ſpirit, which for the most part
ſeemeth good, and is ill; and ſince the Concluſion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the weaker
part, it neceſsarily followes, that the whole fayth of Heretiques, is but
coniecturall, and vncertayne.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> And now
wherein I pray you conſiſts his contradicting both himſelfe, and his
fellowes? Perhaps you meane, becauſe heere he teacheth that euery
Propoſition of fayth muſt be reuealed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and therefore
contradicts his other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that beſids Scripture there are vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Traditions. But the vanity of this obiection will by and by appeare among your
other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which now I ſet down. <hi>First,</hi> you ſee
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> ſpeakes not of fayth in generall, but only of matters of
fayth contayned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his whole queſtion being about the
<hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> thereof, that is. Whether we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the
priuate ſpirit, or humane induſtry of conferring places &amp;c. or els vpon
the Church. <pb n="121" facs="tcp:20773:215"/>And therefore; <hi>Secondly,</hi> he ſayth
not, as you cite him in a different letter, by way of an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal negation,
that a <hi>Propoſition is not de fide,</hi> or not belonging to fayth,
<hi>vnles it be concluded in this Syllogiſme: Whatſoeuer God hath reuealed
in the Scripture is true: but this, or that God hath reuealed in Scripture
&amp;c.</hi> (from whence it would follow that nothing at all could be belieued
which is not contained in Scripture) but he onely ſayth that <hi>a
Propoſition of fayth is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded in this Syllogiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me;</hi> which includes
no vniuerſall negation, but is meant onely of thoſe Propoſitions of fayth
which depend on the interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was the ſubiect of
his diſcourſe. And therefore I wonder why you ſhould ſay in generall;
<hi>this reaſon ſuppoſes that matters of fayth must be reuealed in
Scripture.</hi> For, to teach that ſome matters of faith are in Scripture,
doth not ſuppoſe that all matters of fayth muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in
Scripture, and yet all the contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that heere you find in
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> muſt be this: Such Propoſitions of fayth as are
contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture, are concluded in this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme: <hi>Whatſoeuer
God hath reuealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp;c. Ergo</hi> all Propoſitions of
fayth muſt be concluded in this Syllogiſme; <hi>Ergo</hi> there are no
vnwritten Traditions. A goodly contradiction! <hi>Thirdly,</hi> where did
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> euer teach that the Propoſall of the Church can make
<hi>any vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Verity to become matter of fayth,</hi> as you ſpeake? The
Church doth not make Verities to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <pb n="122" facs="tcp:20773:216"/>of fayth, but
only declares them to be ſuch. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> you leaue out the words
which cleerly explicate in what ſenſe the Teſtimony of the Church may be
ſayd to be <hi>humane,</hi> or diuine; by which your Argument to proue that
the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Church cannot be a ſufficient ground of fayth, had
been anſwered, and your fallacy diſcouered. <hi>Fifihly, Bellarmine</hi>
neuer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, as you ſay he did, that the ſtrength and <hi>truth</hi> of
the <hi>Minor</hi> in the ſayd <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> depends on the
Teſtimony of the Church, but only that it is <hi>most certaine among
Catholiques</hi> by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church, becauſe, as I haue often
ſaid, the Church cannot make any one Article to be <hi>true,</hi> but only by
her declaration can make it <hi>certaine to all Catholiques,</hi> as
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaid. <hi>Sixtly,</hi> you leaue out <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
words, wherby he proues the infallibility of Church and Pope out of Scripture;
and accordingly in the <hi>Scauenth</hi> place, that which he expreſly
ſayth of the vncertaine coniecturall ground of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, which can produce
only a coniecturall and vncertaine Fayth, becauſe the Concluſion followes
the <hi>weaker</hi> part you make him apply to the Teſtimony of the Church as
if it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, which contrarily in the words by you omitted he proues
to be moſt certaine &amp; infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; and therfore the <hi>Concluſion</hi>
which relies vpon a Propoſition deliuered by her, is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to error.
<hi>Eighthly,</hi> you returne to the ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that if <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
doctrine be true, <hi>there is no <pb n="123" facs="tcp:20773:216"/>truth in the
Scriptures, or in our Religion, without the attestation of the Church:</hi> as
if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had taught, that the <hi>truth</hi> of Scripture, and of
all Chriſtian Religion depends on the atteſtation of the Church which could
not in you proceed from ignorance, but from a purpoſe to deceiue your Reader.
For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in that very place which you cite, declares himſelfe
ſo fully and cleerly that you cannot be excuſed from wilfull ſlaunder. I
will put downe the place at large, that heerafter you, and your Brethren may
ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceaſe to make the ſame Obiection, or els endeauour to confute the
Cardinalls anſwere. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> then, makes this obiection againſt
himſelfe: <hi>If the Pope iudge of Scriptures, it followes that the Pope or
Councell is aboue the Scripture: and if the meaning of Scripture without the
Pope or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell be not authenticall, it followes that the word of God takes
his force and strength from the word of men:</hi> And then he giues this
Anſwere: <hi>I anſwere, that this Argument of which Heretiques make
grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test account, conſiſts in a meere Equiuocation. For it may be
vnderstood two manner of wayes that the Church doth iudge of Scriptures: the
one, That ſhe ſhould iudge whether that which the Scripture teaches be
true, or falſe: The other, That putting for a most certaine ground, that the
words of Scripture are most true, she should iudge what is the true
interpretation of them. Now, if the Church did iudge according to the former
way, she should indeed be aboue the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but this we do not ſay,
though we be calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="124" facs="tcp:20773:217"/>by the Heretiques as if we did,
who euery where cry out, that we put the Scripture vnder the Popes Feet. But
that the Church or Pope doth iudge of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures in the latter ſenſe,
which we affirme, is not to ſay, that the Church is aboue Scripture, but
aboue the ſudgment of priuate perſons. For the Church doth not iudge of the
Truth of Scripture, but of the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of thee, and mee, and others.
Neither doth the word of God receiue ſtrength therby, but only my
vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding receiues it. For the Scripture is not more true or certaine,
becauſe it is ſo expounded by the Church; but my Opinion is truer, when it
is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Church.</hi> What ſay you now? Doth <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
teach, that the <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>certainety</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi>
or of the <hi>Minor</hi> in the foreſaid Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme, depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds on the

erre, no more then the Church, becauſe if the Councell could erre, the whole

Councell, or the Pope. Adding further, that the doctrine of the Church vpon
which S. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſayth we are to rely as vpon an infallible Rule, is
no other then that of the Councell. And as for the Pope, he ſayth, that we

Heer is ſuch a Caos of words, and corruptions, <pb n="128" facs="tcp:20773:219"/>as I
ſcarce know where to beginne to vnfold them. <hi>Stapleton</hi> in the place
by you alledged hath this Aſſertion. <hi>The infallibility of teaching in
matters of fayth, granted to the Church, hath place only in defining
infallibly, and propoſing faithfully thoſe doctrines of fayth, which eyther
are called in question, or otherwiſe belong neceſſarily to the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
fayth of the Church.</hi> And afterward he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that <hi>thoſe things
belong neceſsarily to fayth, and publique doctrine of the Church which all
men are bound explicitely to belieue, or els are publikely practiſed by the
Church, or els which the Pastours are bound to belieue explicitely, and the
people implicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the fayth of their Paſtours.</hi> By which words it is

fundamentall, and ſimply neceſſary for the Church, to know and

queſtion, or which are publiquely pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Church, whether they be
funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, or not fundamentall: and therfore you do miſalledge him when
you ſay, that, <hi>he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth Controuerſies of Religion into two

pertaine to the publique fayth of the Church &amp;c.</hi> For
<hi>Stapleton</hi> explicates himſelfe, as you haue heard, that whatſoeuer

infallibility, which is the thing we intend to proue againſt Proteſtants;
that to oppoſe, or <pb n="129" facs="tcp:20773:219"/>queſtion any one doctrine, or

but only ſpeaking of the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Pope <hi>Iohn the two and twentith;</hi>
That the Saints doe not ſee God before the Reſurrection (which is your owne
errour) he excuſeth him from Hereſy, becauſe at that tyme the Church had
not defined the matter. Where you ſee <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeakes only of a

and the thing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not been expreſſely defined by the Church nor

at that tyme a matter of fayth. And he himſelfe before his death retracted

                  <hi>appointed by God to preſent, and propound diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
Verities, is the Church?</hi> And therefore we cannot in the ordinary courſe
belieue Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, or any other diuine Verity, but by the

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:20773:221"/>of the Church. But this doctrine
(that the Church is the firſt Inducer to imbrace the faith, and the ordinary
Meanes without which we cannot belieue) is not <hi>propoſed</hi> by the
Church, and therefore it is not a thing which we can belieue. You likewiſe
grant that the Church is infallible in all fundamentall points. And I aske in
what decree, definition, or declaration hath the Church <hi>propoſed</hi> to
vs, that her ſelfe cannot erre in <hi>fundamentall</hi> points, eſpecially
with your addition, that ſhe may erre in points not <hi>fundamentall?</hi>
Now, to your Argument I an were: <hi>First;</hi> That it is not neceſſary,
that the Church ſhould by any particular decree teſtify her owne
infallibility, becauſe it being euident that ſhe is the ſelfe ſame
Church which was founded by our Sauiour Chriſt, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from the
Apoſtles to this Age, by a neuer interrupted ſucceſſion of Paſtours,
and fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people; it followes that ſhe is the Church of Chriſt: which
being once granted, it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferred, that all are obliged to haue
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to her, and to reſt in her iudgement for all other particular
points which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne faith, or Religion; which we could not be obligd to doe,
if we were perſuaded, that ſhe were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to errour. Which yet is more
euident, if we add, that there can be no Rule giuen in what points, we ſhould
belieue her, and in what not: and therefore we are obliged to belieue her in
all. Moreouer, ſince the true Church muſt be <pb n="134" facs="tcp:20773:222"/>Iudge of
Controuerſies in fayth, as we haue proued, it cleerly followes that ſhe
muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in all points. Which vmuerſall infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity being
ſuppoſed out of the <hi>generall</hi> ground of Gods prouidence, which is
not defectiue in things neceſſary, we may afterward belieue the ſame
infallibility, euen by the Church herſelfe, when ſhe teſtifies that
<hi>particular</hi> point of her owne infallibility: As the Scripture cannot
giue Teſtimony to it ſelfe, till firſt it be belieued to be Gods word,
yet this being once preſuppoſed, it may afterward giue Teſtimony to it
ſelfe, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, that, <hi>All Scripture is

                  <hi>inſpired</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Secondly</hi> I anſwere, that the Church hath
many wayes declared her owne infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. which ſhe profeſſeth euen in
the Apoſtles Creed, <hi>I belieue the holy Catholique Church.</hi> For
<hi>ſhe</hi> could not be <hi>holy,</hi> if ſhe were ſubiect to error in
matters of fayth, which is the firſt foundation of all ſanctity;
<hi>ſhe</hi> could not be <hi>Catholique,</hi> or <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſal</hi> for
all <hi>Ages,</hi> if at any time ſhe could erre, and be Author that the
whole world ſhould erre in points reuealed by God; <hi>ſhe</hi> could not
be <hi>One,</hi> or <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> (as ſhe profeſſeth in another
Creed) if ſhe were <hi>diuided</hi> in points of fayth, or could ſwarue
from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Apostles;</hi> ſhe could not be alwayes
exiſtent and <hi>viſible,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery error in fayth deſtroies
all Fayth, &amp; the Church. So that while the Church, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery faythfull

Church; ſhe, and they belieue &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime her infallibility in all
matters of fayth: which ſhe doth alſo auouch by accurſing all ſuch as
belieue not her definitions; and while in all occaſions of emergent
Controuerſies, ſhe gathers Councels to determine them, without examining
whether they concerne points fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, or not fundamentall; while in all
ſuch holy Aſſemblies, ſhe ſayth with the firſt Councell; <hi>It

any Councels though Generall, may erre. But though that which you affirme were
true, it would fall ſhort of prouing that the Catholique Church is not
infallible in all points. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <pb n="137" facs="tcp:20773:223"/>particular
Churches, or Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, there is the common Conſent of all
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, knowne by perpetuall ſacred Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and there is likewiſe
the continued Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Biſhops and Paſtors, in which if one
ſhould place an vniuerſall infallibility, it were ſufficient to ouerthrow
your aſſertion of the fallibility of the Church. And euen your ſelfe
teach, that the Church is infallible in all fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, and yet you affirme
that any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or Generall Councell may erre, euen to <hi>Hereſy,</hi>
or <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> and <hi>Damnable</hi> errours: And therfore you
muſt grant, that according to your Principles, it is one thing to ſay,
Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels may erre, and another, that the Catholique Church may erre.
But yet for the thing it ſelfe, it is a matter of fayth, that true Generall
Councels, confirmed by the Pope, cannot erre. And if any hold the contrary, he
cannot be excuſed, except by ignorance, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduertence. And as for the
<hi>Romane</hi> Authors which you cite, <hi>Occham</hi> is no competent

they are not ſpoken by him as his opinion, but as the opinion of ſome
others: &amp; ſo he hath alſo the cleane contrary propoſition,
<hi>viz.</hi> that a generall Councell cannot erre, nor euen the
<hi>Remane</hi> Church; which you might as well haue alledged for his opinion
as the other: but the truth is, that neither are alledged by him as his owne
doctrine but as the opinion of others, as I ſaid, which he expreſlly
ſayth that he doth forbeare to diſcuſſe for the preſent, contenting
himſelfe onely with theſe three Concluſions which expreſſe his owne
opinion. Firſt, that alwayes there is ſome Church which is ruled by the law
of Chriſt (which according to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer explication is as much as to ſay,
that there is alwayes ſome Church which cannot erre.) The ſecond, that it
is not conuinced out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that any particular Church is in ſuch
manner conformed to the rule of Chriſts law. The third is, that it is
conuinced out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that alwayes there is ſome vniuerſall Church
which neuer ſwarues from the rule of Chriſt. Neither will it aduantage you,
that he teacheth that any particular Church may erre; For as I haue often told
you, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in the ſenſe which I haue heertofore
declared, is all one with the <hi>Vniuerſall</hi> Church, and ſo his
doctrine that the <hi>Vniuerſall</hi> Church cannot erre directly proues,
that the <hi>Romane</hi> cannot erre. And when he teacheth, that the
Vniuerſall Church cannot erre, he doth not diſtinguiſh 
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:20773:225"/>betwixt points fundamentall, and not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, as
you do. You cite out of <hi>Canus</hi> theſe words: <hi>I

hereticall,</hi> which he proues by diuers good conuincing reaſons, and among
the reſt, that <hi>if ſuch a Councell could erre, there were no way

indeed a happy thing, and a moſt effectuall way to end all Controuerſies if
people would ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſome viſible liuing Iudge, by whom

refuſe to do, no wonder, if we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to alledge Scriptures, and
Fathers, as you likewiſe do, though you ſay, that Scripture is infallible,
and that all Controuerſies muſt be decided by it alone. Beſides, though
the Pope be infallible, yet he is not ſo alone, as if he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all
other infallible meanes: for Scriptures, Generall Councells, and the Conſent
of the <pb n="150" facs="tcp:20773:230"/>whole Catholique Church are alſo infallible. And
therfore (as I was ſaying) it is no wonder that we alledge other Arguments
beſides the decrees of Popes alone. For ſince in our diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes with you,
we abound with all kind of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, why ſhould we not make vſe therof?
And if you will know the reaſon why Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells be gathered to the great good

<hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Preſcriptions</hi> againſt Heretiques doth

infallible, but the ſole Rule alſo of fayth: How then do you infer

pertinacity in their Errour about the Holy Ghoſt, vpon the very feaſt of
Pentecoſt (as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> proueth) the Citty of Conſtantinople was

that either it is meant for time of Schiſme, or if it be vniuerſall, that

diſtinguiſhes two Queſtions: The one, whether <hi>S. Peter</hi> had any

whether it be <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> or of diuine inſtitution, that <hi>S.
Peters</hi> Succeſſour muſt be the particular Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and this he ſayth is not ſo certayne (though it be true) becauſe if
<hi>S. Peter</hi> had placed his Sea in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Citty, or els had
choſen no particular Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all; yet his Succeſſour had been, <hi>iure

particular Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Neuertheles, becauſe <hi>S. Peter</hi>
did in fact, chooſe <hi>Rome,</hi> it is vpon that ſuppoſall a matter of
fayth, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Peters</hi>
Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour is all one. As for example by the Law of God all lawfull

                  <hi>Bellarmine. S. Peter ſate many yeares Bisſhop of Rome,
&amp; there he died</hi> You cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the very Queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Bellarmines</hi>
words in the Title of the Chapter are: <hi>Petrum Romae vſque admor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
Epiſcopum fuiſſe. That S. Peter was Bishop of <pb n="156" facs="tcp:20773:233"/>Rome
till his death.</hi> And he explaines his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be, That <hi>S. Peter was
Bishop of Rome, and that he kept that Bishoprick till his death:</hi> which is
a different thing from what you ſay; That <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſate <hi>many
yeares Bishop of Rome, and there he died.</hi> For he might haue been many
yeares Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, and alſo died at <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet not died
Biſhop of Rome; as one may be Biſhop of London for ſome yeares, and dy at
London, &amp; yet not dye Biſhop of London. Now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayth,
that <hi>S. Peter</hi> died Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which indeed was the
maine point; and proues, that the Biſhop of Rome is <hi>S. Peters</hi>
ſucceſſour; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to dye at <hi>Rome</hi> is accidentall to his being
Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in fact diuers Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> died
in <hi>France,</hi> and els where. But let vs goe on. You ſay that the
firſt reaſon by which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> proues that <hi>S. Peter</hi>
died Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is ſo <hi>weake,</hi> that himſelfe ſayth
only <hi>ſuadere vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, it ſeemes to perſwade.</hi> This
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayth only of one reaſon, beſides which he bringeth
diuers other demonſtrations: neither is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the certainty
of any truth, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon for it, be euident. And it is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Philoſophers, that the beſt methode is, to begin with probable
Arguments, and then to aſcend to demonſtrations. Moreouer in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſubiect <hi>Vdalricus Velenus,</hi> a Lutheran, wrote a Booke to proue that
<hi>S. Peter</hi> was neuer at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to that purpoſe he brings
eighteen reaſons, which he calls <hi>Perſuaſions,</hi> &amp; yet he holds
them <pb n="157" facs="tcp:20773:233"/>for euident <hi>Demonstrations.</hi> If then
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> out of his great modeſty ſay, that his firſt
reaſon ſeemes to <hi>perſuade,</hi> muſt you thence inferre, that it
doth not <hi>demonſtrate?</hi> And indeed it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, and ſolid
argument. After this you go forward, and cite <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaying:
<hi>There God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded him to fixe his Chaire, &amp; to leaue his full Power
to his heyres and Succeſſours, the Popes.</hi> And then you adde: But what

                  <hi>expreſſed
in Scripture, that the Pope</hi> (you ſhould add <hi>of Rome,</hi> as
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath it) <hi>ſucceeds Peter, &amp; therefore happily it
is not of diuine right that he ſucceeds him;</hi> Yet, <hi>it is not

                  <hi>God commanded him to fasten his Seate at Rome, and it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly ſo
belieued.</hi> And it may be truly belieued, that you corrupt <hi>Bellarmine.
First,</hi> when you ſpeake of Popes, you leaue out, <hi>of Rome,</hi> in
which word conſiſteth the maine point. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teaches,
that it is moſt certaine, and <hi>de iure diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> that <hi>S.
Peter</hi> should haue Popes to ſucceed him, but he holdeth it not ſo
certaine, whether it be of <hi>diuine institution,</hi> that his Succeſsour
ſhould be Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> that is, haue his Seate fixed at
<hi>Rome,</hi> although <hi>de facto</hi> it be there. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi>
wordes are: <hi>It is not all one, that a thing be a point of fayth, and that
it be of diuine institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it was not a diuine Law that S. Paul ſhould
haue a cloake, yet it is a point of fayth that S. Paul had a Cloake. Though
then it be not exprſly contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture, that the Bishop of Rome
should <pb n="158" facs="tcp:20773:234"/>ſucceed S. Peter</hi> (thus far you goe, and
leaue out the words immediately following, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the whole matter:)
<hi>Yet it is euidently deduced out of Scripture that ſome must ſucceed S.
Peter: but that he who ſucceeds him is the Biſhop of Rome, we know by the
Apostolicall Tradition of S. Peter; which Tradition, Generall Councels, Decrees
of Popes, and Conſent of Fathers, haue declared, as heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall be
demonstrated.</hi> And according to this cleere explication he ſaid a little
before: <hi>Becauſe S. Marcellus Pope in his Epistle ad Antiochenos, writes
that S. Peter came to Rome by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lord; and S.

                  <hi>affirme, that S. Peter ſuffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at Rome by the
commandment of Christ; it is not improbable, that our Lord did alſo
expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that S. Peter should ſo ſettle his Seate at Rome, that
the Bishop of Rome ſhould abſolutely ſucceed him. But howſoeuer this
be, at leſt this manner of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion proceeds not from the first
institution of the Popedome, which is deliuered in Scripture.</hi> Do you not
ſee what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> deliuers for certaine, &amp; what for leſſe
certaine? It is certaine that <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> muſt haue Succeſſours;
it is certaine that in fact his Succeſſour is the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome:</hi> but it is not ſo certaine, that by diuine inſtitution, his
Succeſſour is the Biſhop of Rome, but that might proceed from the act of
<hi>S. Peter,</hi> who actually liued and died Biſhop of Rome, though he
might haue choſen ſome other particular Dioceſse. Theſe things
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> deliuers very <pb n="159" facs="tcp:20773:234"/>cleerly; but you do
ſo inuolue his words, as one would belieue, that he held it for vncertaine,
whether actually the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> be <hi>S. Peters</hi> Succeſsour,
or whether it be certaine, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inſtitution, that <hi>S. Peter</hi>

               <p n="31">31. Your other obiections are ſo old and triuiall, that
they deſerue no Anſwere: I ſayd already, that in time of Schiſme the
Church hath power to declare, or elect a true and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Pope; and in the
meane tyme God in his Prouidence can gouerne his Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out new

any one Generall Councell; and as the Iewes for two thouſand yeares were

the Churh as Pope, God will eyther not permit him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine any matter of

affirme, that a Pope accepted for ſuch by the Church, is ſufficiently
enabled for all neceſſary acts and functions, notwithſtanding that
ſecret impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment: For otherwiſe you might endanger the Authority of your
owne Prelates. And the ſame you muſt in proportion ſay, of all publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
Magiſtrates. The ſame anſwere ſerues to your other Obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we
are not ſure whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that is elected Pope be baptized. For it belongs to
Gods prouidence, not to permit any whome the Church hath elected for her head,
to erre perniciouſly, though indeed your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are neuer to be
admitted; but we are to belieue that whoſoeuer in a tyme free from Schiſme,
is accepted by the Church for true Pope, is ſuch indeed. And I wonder you doe
not reflect, that theſe obiections are alſo againſt your owne Biſhops.
Or if you ſay, that your ſpirituall Iuriſdiction comes from the
Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Prince, the ſame difficulty wil remaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him. For I
ſuppoſe you will not ſay that one who is not baptized, and conſequently
not a Chriſtian, can meerly by vertue of his Temporall Power giue
ſpirituall Iuriſdiction. And though you ſay that it is not want of
<hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the Miniſter which can make voyde the Sacrament of
Baptiſme; yet you will not deny, but that there may be other
<hi>eſſentiall</hi> defects, hindring the validity therof: as for example,
if by error the water be ſo mingled, that it be not <pb n="161" facs="tcp:20773:235"/>elementall water; or if the forme of the words in Baptiſme be not
pronounced entierely &amp;c. For in your forme of Publique Baptiſme it is
ſaid: <hi>That water, and; in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of
the Holy Ghost, are eſſentiall parts of Baptiſme:</hi> and this you haue
gained by your obiections. And finally if your doctrine be true that
<hi>intention</hi> in the Miniſter is not neceſsary, the Pope cannot
(according to your doctrine) want Baptiſme for want of due intention in the
Miniſter. You proceed.</p>

ioyned in Communion with the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of <hi>S. Peter.</hi> And this
<hi>Baronius</hi> proues out of <hi>Optatus.</hi> Wherby it appeares that the
intention of thoſe <hi>formed</hi> Letters was not to expreſſe all
fundamentall points of fayth, but particularly aymed at the <hi>Arrians:</hi>
&amp; beſides the Articles of our <hi>Creed,</hi> they contained the Primacy
of <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> teaching vs that it is neceſſary for euery true
Catholique to be vnited with the Sea of <hi>Peter.</hi> You cite the circular
letters of <hi>Sophronius, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſius, Pelagius</hi> Patriarch of Rome, and
<hi>Photius</hi> of Conſtantinople &amp; for thoſe of <hi>Pelagius</hi> you
cite <hi>Baronius</hi> (Ann. 556. n. 33.) But the letters of <hi>Pelagius</hi>
which <hi>Baronius</hi> ſets downe at large, do not ſo much as mention the
Apoſtles Creed: and beſides the foure ſix <hi>Generall Councels,</hi> he
profeſſes to receiue <hi>the Canons which the Sea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolique</hi> (that
is, the <hi>Romane</hi> Sea) hath receiued, the Epiſtles of the Popes,
<hi>Celestine, Sixtus, Leo, Hilarius, Simplicius, Felix, Gelaſius</hi> (the
firſt) <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastaſius, Hormiſda, Iohn, Felix, Boniface, Iohn,
Agapetus;</hi> and then adds: <hi>This is my Fayth.</hi> I wonder by what
Logick you will inferre out of theſe Letters, that the Creed alone, explaned 
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20773:241"/>by the firſt Councells, containes all Articles of
fayth, ſince <hi>Pelagius</hi> profeſſes to receiue diuers other things
not contained in the Creed. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronius</hi> alſo (<hi>Sext. Synod.
Act.</hi> 11.) in his letters recites, and condemnes by name a very great
number of particular Hereſies, and Hetetiques which are not mentioned in any
of the <hi>Creeds,</hi> and adds a full condemnation of all Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques.
Neither are you more fortunate or fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in <hi>Taraſius,</hi> who in his
<hi>Confeſsion</hi> of fayth doth expreſly teach Inuocation of our
bleſsed Lady, Angels, Apoſtles, Prophets, Martyrs, Confeſſors &amp;c.
as alſo worſhip of <hi>Images,</hi> of which he was a moſt zealous
defender againſt the <hi>Iconomacht,</hi> and was the chiefe in the
<hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Synod,</hi> who condemned thoſe Heretiques. And ſince he
was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> famous both for ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and miracles, we may note by the way,
what perſons they were who in ancient times oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Proteſtants in
thoſe <hi>Iconomachi. Photius</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is by you misalledged. For he
in his Letter to Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſet downe by <hi>Baronius</hi>
(<hi>ad Ann.</hi> 859.) wherein he maketh a profeſſion of his fayth, fayth:
<hi>I receiue the ſeauen holy Generall Councels.</hi> And hauing mentioned
the ſix Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and what Heretiques were condemned by them, he adds: <hi>I
alſo receyue that holy, and great Councell, which was the ſecond held at
Nice, which cast out, and ouercame, as filth, the Iconomachi, that is, the
oppugners of Images, who therfore were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomachi, that is, oppugners of
Christ, as alſo the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugners <pb n="174" facs="tcp:20773:242"/>of Saints.</hi> Tell me
now, I pray you, by what art can you extract out of <hi>Photius</hi> his
Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, an argument to proue, that the Apoſtles Creed <hi>as it was explaned
in the Creeds of Nice, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, Epheſus, Chalcedon, and Athanaſius,
comprehends a perfect Catalogue of fundamentall truths, and implyes a full
reiection of fundamentall hereſies</hi> (as you affirme <hi>pag.</hi> 217)
ſince he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly profeſses to receiue alſo the ſeauen Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Councels, and that in particular, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the <hi>Impugners of
Images,</hi> that is, ſuch as your ſelfe and other Proteſtants are? Will
you grant that the Creed <hi>implies a reiection</hi> of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the
<hi>Iconomachi,</hi> or oppoſers of Images, as of a <hi>Fundamentall</hi>
Hereſie? Who will not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at your ill fortune in mis-alledging Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors?
Yet I grant that fraude can neuer be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed better, then to the
diſaduantage of him, who vſeth it.</p>

                  </note>

of Saints is all one, the latter being only an Explication of the other.</hi>
But what is this for your purpoſe, which was to proue that Articles not
expreſſed in the Creed, cannot be reduced to the Catholique Church;
<hi>Becauſe no learned Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manist will ſay that the new doctrines of the
Romane Church are contained</hi> in the Communion of Saints? For Cardinall
<hi>Peron</hi> only means, what he ſayth in expreſse words; That the

nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the faithfull, euery one conſidered a part; but in the ioynt
Communion alſo of the whole body of the faythfull: From whence it doth not
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Church is not ſhe, who ought to deliuer, and propound
diuine Verities to vs as ſhe is the Mother and Teacher of all Chriſtians.
Doth not <hi>Charity</hi> and Communion in the ſpirit of <hi>Loue</hi>
include <hi>Fayth;</hi> and conſequently ſome infallible Propounder of the
Articles therof? The Explication of <hi>Azor,</hi> concerning the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of
the Catholique Church which you bring, maketh nothing in the world to your
purpoſe. I haue told you already, that while we belieue the <hi>Vnity,
Vniuerſality, Perpetuity, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity</hi> of the Church, we ioyntly belieue
her <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> and freedome from all error in fayth. But it is a
meere ſlaunder to talke, as if we held that ſhe had <hi>ſoueraigne and
infallible power to preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe, or define what ſhe pleaſes.</hi> You
ſay, that the Creed is a ſufficient Rule of fayth, <hi>to which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
eſsentiall can be added, or may be detracted:</hi> As if the addition of
<hi>Materiall</hi> obiects, added any thing to the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of
faith, which is taken, not from the materiall <hi>Obiect,</hi> or the things
which we belieue, but from the <hi>Formall Obiect,</hi> and <hi>Motiue,</hi>
which is the <hi>Testimony</hi> of Almighty God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Though it were granted, that the Creed being rightly
vnderſtood, contaynes all fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, yet doth it not follow that
Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants <pb n="176" facs="tcp:20773:243"/>agree in them, both becauſe they may
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree in the meaning of ſome of thoſe Articles; as alſo, becauſe
diſagrement in any one point of <hi>Fayth,</hi> though not fundamentall,
cannot ſtand with the <hi>Vnity,</hi> and ſubſtance of fayth, euen in
ſuch points as both of them belieue. As for the Authour of the <hi>Examen
pacifique,</hi> I haue told you already, that he is no Catholique.</p>
               <p n="6">6. You ſet down your owne opinion about the
neceſſity of good workes, which you know is contrary to many of your prime
Brethren; yet, this I will not vrge for the preſent, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that
you forget that <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other inſtances, alledges
this to proue that all points of fayth are not contained in the Creed; to which
you giue no anſwere at all, but only tell vs what your owne opinion is. And
that it may appeare how you comply with your promiſe, not to <hi>omit without
Anſwere any one thing of moment;</hi> heare what <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi>
ſayth to this purpoſe, in theſe words. <hi>S. Peter ſayth, that S. Paul
in his Epiſtles had written certaine things, which were hard to be
vnderſtood, and which the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and vnstable, did peruert to their owne
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. S. Austen declares vpon this place, that the places
miſvnderstood concerned the doctrine of Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which ſome
miſconceiued to be by fayth alone. And of purpoſe to countermine that
error, he ſayth, that S. Iames wrote his Epistle, and proued therin that good
works were abſolutely neceſsary to the act of Iustification. Heereupon we
may obſerue two things; <pb n="177" facs="tcp:20773:243"/>the one, that an error in this
point alone, is by the iudgment of S. Peter, to worke their destruction, who
imbrace it: and the other, that the Apostles Creed which ſpeakes no one word
therof, is no good rule, to let vs know all the fundamentall points of
fayth.</hi> Did not all this diſcourſe deſerue ſome anſwere from one,
who profeſſes <hi>to omit nothing?</hi>

Marriage muſt be ill, becauſe a ſingle lyfe is better. Why doe you not
lay the ſame aſperſion vpon our Sauiour Chriſt, who propoſed
Chaſtity as one of the Euangelicall Councells; vpon <hi>S. Paul,</hi> who

their wiues, becauſe it is written: Be holy, becauſe I am holy, ſayth our
Lord.</hi> Is this to ſay abſolutely, that Marriage is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with
holines becauſe it is incompatible with that holines which by the Churches
Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is required in Prieſts? S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, that an

                  <hi>and a Virgin thinkes of things belonging to God, that she may be holy in
body and ſoule.</hi> Will you hence inferre, that the <hi>Apostle</hi>
affirmes, Marriage to be incompatible with holines, becauſe it is
incompatible with that peculiar holines, which Virginity is apt to breed?
Thoſe words, <hi>Be holy, becauſe I am holy,</hi> are taken out of

touch certaine beaſts: and yet I hope you will not accuſe God of
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicheiſme,</hi> as if the eating of ſuch beaſts were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible
with holines? The other words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by <hi>Innocentius, Thoſe who are in

par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular holines and pleaſing of God, which is required in thoſe that

                  <hi>Not only the Marriage of Priests, which is ſacriledge &amp; not marriage;

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gruous &amp; conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it is, that Prieſts ſhould lead a ſingle lyfe,
after many <pb n="179" facs="tcp:20773:244"/>Authorities of Scriptures, Councels, &amp;
Fathers proues it alſo by reaſon it ſelfe, in regard that Marriage is a
great impediment to Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call functions; and beginning with the
action of ſacrificing, he ſayth: Matrimony, as <hi>Saint Hierome</hi>
ſaith <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>in Iouinian.</hi> hinders the office of
<hi>ſacrificing,</hi> becauſe there is required moſt great purity and
ſanctity therein, as <hi>S. Chryſostome</hi> in his <hi>ſixt Booke of
Prieſthood</hi> doth declare; and it cannot <hi>be denyed, but that in the
act of Marriage there is mingled a certaine impurity and pollution, not which
is ſinne, but which aroſe from ſinne. For though Caluin exclayme against
Pope Siricius,</hi> who is ſo ancient that he ſate <hi>an.</hi> 385.
<hi>becauſe he called the Marriage of Priests, Pollution; yet that not only
the Marriage of Priests, which is not marriage but ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but alſo
the Martrimony of holy perſons is not exerciſed without a certayne
pollution and turpitude, appeares by the rebellion of nature, and the
ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of men in that act, who alwayes ſeeke to be hidden, as S.
Auguſtine hath obſerued, lib.</hi> 14. <hi>de Ciuitate Dei. cap.</hi> 17.
Thus <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> and indeed <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> in the next
<hi>Chap.</hi> expreſly ſpeakes <hi>de pudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Concubitus non ſolum
vulgari, ſed etiam coniuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</hi> And now what but malice can reprehend any
one tittle in this doctrine of <hi>Bellarmine?</hi> or rather in the doctrine
of the Fathers by him cited, which containes againſt you, Sacrifice, &amp;
ſingle life of Prieſts? Moreouer you falſify both <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius</hi>
and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who ſpeake not of <hi>Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge in it ſelfe,</hi>
of which you make them ſpeake in <pb n="180" facs="tcp:20773:245"/>your Text, but of the
act thereof; and therfore <hi>Innocentius</hi> ſayth: <hi>Qui exercent cum
vxore carnale conſortium;</hi> And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſayth: <hi>Non
exercetur ſine pollutione quadam &amp;c.</hi> Which is not euen ſo much as
to ſay, the act it ſelfe is pollution, but only, <hi>Non exercetur ſine
pollutione &amp;c.</hi> and this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo not abſolutely, but with a
limitation, <hi>non ſine pollutione quadam &amp;c.</hi> For Matrimony of it
ſelfe, may ſtand with moſt perfect Chaſtity, yea with Virginity, as
appeareth in the moſt <hi>Immaculate Mother of God.</hi> And at this day, a
married man may be made Prieſt, if his wife conſent, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conditions
preſcribed in the holy Canons be obſerued. And wheras you ſay, <hi>It
ſeemes by S. Augustine, they</hi> (the Manichees) <hi>did not forbid meates,
or marriage as abſolutely impure, or to all: only their choyce Elect ones
muſt obstaine; the other vulgar, their Auditors, were lefte at their
liberty:</hi> This obiection taken out of <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> is anſwered
by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the Chapter next to that which you cited, that <hi>S.
Auguſtine lib.</hi> 30. <hi>contra Faustum cap.</hi> 6. <hi>writes, that the
Manichees did abſolutly forbid Marriage, becauſe though they did permit it
to their Auditors, yet it was only for that they could not do otherwiſe. You
cannot</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Augustine</hi>) <hi>ſay that you do not
forbid</hi> (Mariage) <hi>becauſe without breach of friendſhip you tolerate
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your Auditors, being either not willing, or not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obey you in
this.</hi> Thus <hi>S. Augustine. But we do not only permit, or tolerate the
Marriage of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but do alſo commend them. And beſides the 
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20773:245"/>Manichees did ſo permit Marriage to their Auditours for
ſatisfying their lust, that they iointly warned them to auoid procreation of
Children, which is manifeſtly to deteſt Marriage. But Catholiques do
therfore chiefly commend Marriage, becauſe it is knowne to haue been
inſtituted by God for the procreation of Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Thus
<hi>Bellarmine.</hi> And now I hope you ſee how free he is from
<hi>Manicheiſme,</hi> &amp; that the places which in your Margent you alledge
out of <hi>S. Aug.</hi> to proue that ſome of the Manichees might marry, are
brought by you very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to his expres wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, in the place which now we
haue heard <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> cite out of him. The doctrine of
<hi>Costerus</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Enchiriae, cap. de Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lib.</note>

is very true, becauſe Matrimony in a Prieſt is no Matrimony at all by
reaſon of his ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne vow of Chaſtity, &amp; the Churches prohibition, as

What ſay you to <hi>S. Chryſostome,</hi> who ſayth, that Marriage after a

alſo cals<note n="(q)" place="margin">In lib. ad Virginem lapſam. c.
<hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> the Marriage of a vowed Virgin, <hi>Adultery.</hi> Now
ſuppoſing this doctrine of Catholiques, that the Matrimony of Prieſts is
no Matrimony; it followes that by attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting to contract Matrimony, beſides
the ſinnes <pb n="182" facs="tcp:20773:246"/>of fornication and Sacriledge, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mits a
grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous diſobedience to the Church, a ſacrilegious irreuerence againſt
the Sacrament of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which he celebrates inualidly; and may be
preſumed alſo to add a profeſſion of <hi>Hereſy,</hi> as if the
Church could not forbid, or make voyd the Marriage of Clergy men; as in fact,
<hi>Luther,</hi> &amp; ſuch Apoſtata's ſinned not only againſt
Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, againſt their vow, againſt the Sacrament of Marriage,
againſt the precept of the Church; but alſo againſt <hi>Faith:</hi> &amp;
laſtly both they and al Prieſts that marry, doe to the vttermoſt of their
power, adde a greater immobility in ſinne, then if they did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit
fornication, without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to marry. But I beſeech you doth he, who
teaches that a double ſinne is committed by abuſing Marriage, teach thereby
that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is ill, &amp; vnlawfull; or rather doth he not ſhew that in it
ſelfe it is holy and muſt not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed? If one ſhould not onely
commit inceſt within the forbidden degrees, but alſo attempt to marry,
ſhould not he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit a greater ſinne by the abuſe of Marriage ioyned with

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, then by inceſt alone?
Or is it not a greater ſinne both to commit Adultery, and attempt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with the Adultreſſe, while his lawfull wife liues, then onely to commit
Adultery? The one by the lawes of the Kingdome is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with death, but
not the other. So as it is cleere that the doctrine of <hi>Costerus</hi> cannot
be blamed, but by ſuch as oppoſe the Church, and <pb n="183" facs="tcp:20773:246"/>all
Antiquity, about Marriage after a ſolemne vow of Chaſtity. But if
<hi>Costerus</hi> deſerue blame, what ſay you to your Patriarch

                  </note> if the Councell ſhould grant Churchmen liberty

her corruptions; If they be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to marry, they will rather chooſe to
be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famouſly wicked, then to marry. In your firſt <hi>Edition,</hi> you

they will ſpeake with coherence to their other grounds? For as the

their <hi>Elect:</hi> ſo doe Proteſtants ſay, that thoſe who haue the
gift of Chaſtity not onely may, but ought to abſtaine from Marriage,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they teach that there are no workes of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation, but that men

o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to lawfull Superiours is good: and if faſting to ſubdue the

conſiſting of men agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only in <hi>fundamentall</hi> points, is indeed
a Chymera, or <hi>non Ens.</hi> For it is impoſſible that there can be a
viſible Church, which profeſſing fundamentall points, doth not in other
points eyther agree with vs, or you, or els diſagrees from vs both. For
eyther they muſt hold, for example, the Reall Preſence,
Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, Prayer for the dead, and to Saints, Worſhip 
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20773:254"/>of Images, Supremacy of the Pope, Sufficiency of one kind

pernicious fallacy, wherby you deceiue your ſelfe, and others; as if there

vnles it extend to all points ſufficiently propounded as diuine Truths, the

ſo vnited in one life, that a deadly blow receiued immediately but in one,
doth neceſſarily redound to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all: ſo all the obiects
